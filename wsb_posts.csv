I started my $TSLA short position 83 days ago and timed the top of the market (you can check my comments), opening $480p. I closed them and eventually entered back in aggressively starting 20 days ago when the stock price was at $350/share.

I've officially closed my puts, most recently holding 325x $200p Aug 15 puts. Today alone, I made $396k from the TSLA puts.

Other notable plays was $100k of $QBTS while it was under $1/share after I read¬†an article about Chinese researchers cracking encryption using their tech. I made around $300k before closing my position.

Fidelity is a great platform, but their charting takes 24 hours to update and they remove gain/loss if you close the position completely, but you can see my performance in the below pictures.

As a side note, the massive decline in November was associated with IWM puts that got massively underwater from the Trump pump. I held through that entire pump and decline, and was down as much as 80% at one point, before closing for a little loss of 15%.

The negative -$83k is shown because I've withdrawn more money than I've put into the accounts.

**Playboi Carti (Self Titled)** \- April 14th, 2017

Playboi Carti's first mixtape was released on April 14th, 2017. Although the market was closed that day, on the next trading day, April 17th, SPY went up +0.62%.

**Die Lit** \- May 11th, 2018

His next album was released on May 11th, 2018. The following trading session netted a +0.25% gain for SPY.

**Whole Lotta Red** \- December 25th, 2020

Released on Christmas Day, on the following trading session SPY went up again at a +0.12% gain. But when we compare it to the previous close, it gained +0.86%.

**Music** \- March 14th, 2025

Today, Playboi Carti released his newest album and the stock market response is clear. At the time of writing, SPY is up almost +2% with 1 hour to go until close. Clearly, the market rises every time Playboi Carti drops an album and this would explain the rise today.

First let me start off by saying I'm not a bitcoin bull and think it's all bullshit. However, I've been trading it for the past 6 years and made a ton of money doing so. Why? Because bitcoin ALWAYS pumps off of any catalyst. $MSTR is a stock that holds bitcoin and is a way to buy call options and make a ton of money off it's moves.

Over the weekend CNBC announced on Friday this week the White House is hosting it's first ever Bitcoin Summit and they are going to lay out the ground work for a Bitcoin Reserve and Trump is going to speak about the future of crypto. The most obvious play is ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" going into this event. All bitcoin holders have been waiting since the election to find out more about the Bitcoin Reserve and that's all they care about. $MSTR has been meeting with Trump and the administration and will be one of the leaders in this effort. Now that the tariffs finally hit I believe $MSTR OTM calls are an easy 50 bagger and it will go back to the $300 level it ALREADY hit yesterday and higher going into Fridays event.

Edit 1: Around 12 PM today it was announced CEO of $MSTR (Micahel Saylor) will be joining the Crypto event on Friday at the White House with Trump

Will Bitcoin Burn Everyone This Time?,3019,1jeis5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jeis5p/will_bitcoin_burn_everyone_this_time/,698,2025-03-19 04:38:58,"MicroStrategy has accumulated nearly 500,000 BTC, but they are now slowing down their purchases. If they start liquidating strategically, they could crash Bitcoin without anyone noticing until it's too late.

Imagine the perfect play:

They sell slowly OTC to avoid scaring the market.

Meanwhile, they short BTC with leverage to maximize profits.

Once support breaks, they dump everything, triggering liquidations.

Bitcoin crashes below 30k, ETFs see massive outflows, and they cash in billions.


If BTC no longer grows exponentially, MicroStrategy is trapped. They either exit now with a profit or risk imploding with the asset. And if they decide to sell, we could witness the biggest Big Short in crypto history.

Too paranoid or a plausible scenario?

P.S. This strategy is known as ""sell against the box"" ‚Äî a classic risk management tactic used by institutional investors.
It allows an entity to hedge their long position by shorting the same asset, locking in profits without ever selling directly.

By doing this, MicroStrategy could simply drain the market's volatility, generate liquidity, and accumulate even more BTC ‚Äî all while maintaining a fully bullish narrative and never letting the public see a single direct sale.

It‚Äôs time to call bullshit,3038,1jfwuvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jfwuvf/its_time_to_call_bullshit/,1087,2025-03-21 00:41:02,"I‚Äôll share a screenshot of my positions in a thread below, so if that‚Äôs all you‚Äôre here for go ahead and look.

My fellow regards, I believe it‚Äôs time to call bullshit on this market. Please understand, I don‚Äôt care who you voted for‚Ä¶ I guarantee I like you a hell of a lot more than I like the banks, and that is exactly who the winner is going to be unless people wake up to the reality of our situation quickly. 

Before touching any kind of political news, let‚Äôs start with market indicators. 

BofA‚Äôs recent mm survey showed that most MM‚Äôs are reducing their share of US equities (source 1 below), there are other signs the banks are getting out as well (check my second to last post), BlackRock is struggling to find buyers. 

At the same time, a record number of American households now own stock in US equities (source 2 below). Now, from what I know about American households (I live in one), most of us live paycheck to paycheck‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt really have money to put into stocks willy-nilly.


So what does all of this mean? 

Well, my thesis is that the average American has their rent/mortgage in US equities tied up in stocks like Tesla right now as an act of patriotism‚Ä¶ what saddens me most is that I appreciate this general sentiment (not for Tesla necessarily, but I do actually love my country despite what the news may tell you), but the banks are taking advantage of it. So what happens when all the sudden everyone has to pay their bills? 

That‚Äôs right‚Ä¶ another mass sell off. 

Please believe me when I say that I hope I‚Äôm wrong, this is not going to be good for average, working people with, at the very least, good-hearted intentions‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt see any signs to indicate that I am.

Now we‚Äôll touch a bit on economic outlook and history:

We are currently still in a battle with inflation, JPow said it yesterday, even before tariffs we were looking at 2 more years before we return to normal and the outlook with tariffs puts it all on pause. He hedged to say ‚Äòthey aren‚Äôt sure how tariffs will affect inflation‚Äô, let me fill in the gap there: either tariffs will affect inflation (because the costs are passed on to consumers) or they will affect earnings (because companies absorb them)‚Ä¶ the money has to come from somewhere. If it affects inflation, the fed will be forced to raise interest rates or at the very least pause on cuts indefinitely. If it doesn‚Äôt affect inflation, it will affect earnings/growth‚Ä¶ if this sounds familiar, then you may have heard of stagflation. And if you study the history of the federal reserve, you may know what the solution to that problem is‚Ä¶ Volcker‚Äôs hammer. You can look it up yourself but the gist is that in the late 70‚Äôs we had been battling inflation and stagnant growth for years, until Paul Volcker was appointed to head the federal reserve and raised interest rates to 20%‚Ä¶ it absolutely crushed the economy, sent us to the stone ages‚Ä¶ but it did reset our inflation and led us into a very booming 80‚Äôs. 

I want to reiterate‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt like either side politically, they‚Äôre all in bed with the banks. The only reason I‚Äôm posting this is because I‚Äôm angry at the thought of them getting super leveraged on overpriced stocks and then dumping it on average people. This has so many shades of 2008 it‚Äôs not funny. Feel free to argue, bet against me, whatever‚Ä¶ I genuinely don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôve been a value investor since I was 14 and I‚Äôm currently 28. I held through 2020 and 2022, this time feels much much different. 

Whatever you decide to do with this information, be safe out there.

I kept on adding more money but it never worked and by the end of Feb I was down 10k‚Ä¶ 

I had my final 15k left and I made an ‚Äúeducated‚Äù gamble on how SPY would react to some upcoming news and when the news dropped I was up from 15->20k within 2 minutes. I figured fuck it let me just hold until 25k but the market immediately corrected and I lost everything.

>A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a **Crypto Strategic Reserve** that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA. I will make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World. We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114093946326587357

But, there's no such language in the Executive Order, only language is about a stockpile from seized crypto by law enforcement agencies:

>(c)  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Working Group shall submit a report to the President, through the APEP, which shall recommend regulatory and legislative proposals that advance the policies established in this order.  In particular, the report shall focus on the following:
(i)   The Working Group shall propose a Federal regulatory framework governing the issuance and operation of digital assets, including stablecoins, in the United States.  The Working Group‚Äôs report shall consider provisions for market structure, oversight, consumer protection, and risk management.
(ii)  **The Working Group shall evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile and propose criteria for establishing such a stockpile, potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts.**

https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/strengthening-american-leadership-in-digital-financial-technology/

There's not a single mention of a strategic reserve in the EO. Trump knows this, or maybe he doesn't (or doesn't know the difference between a stockpile or a reserve) or he did a play on words for other nefarious reasons, i.e., tariffs coming Tuesday.

'The arrival of the tariff inflation': Powell doesn't shy from linking trade to prices as Fed shifts forecasts,2146,1jfctg2,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-arrival-of-the-tariff-inflation-powell-doesnt-shy-from-linking-trade-to-prices-as-fed-shifts-forecasts-205345292.html,173,2025-03-20 06:21:14,"Jerome Powell did not shy away from the impact of President Trump‚Äôs tariffs during a highly anticipated press conference Wednesday.

The Federal Reserve chairman said in no uncertain terms that Trump's trade agenda would be likely to drive up prices, even amid considerable uncertainty about exactly how much ‚Äî and whether the price changes would be ""transitory.""

In just one example Wednesday afternoon during a question about price stability, Powell said that inflation had previously neared the Fed's key goal but now ""I do think with the arrival of the tariff inflation, further progress may be delayed.""

It was just one of numerous comments from the central banker that contrasted with past meetings where he often declined to weigh in on the topic in detail.

The remarks from Powell came after the Fed on Wednesday decided to hold interest rates steady and maintained a prediction of two rate cuts later this year.

What the central bank did change was its outlook on inflation (higher) and economic growth (lower). And those upward inflation adjustments, Powell said, are ""really due to the tariffs coming in.""

US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference after the Monetary Policy Committee meeting, at the Federal Reserve in Washington, DC on March 19, 2025. Powell said Wednesday that inflation has started to rise in part due to President Donald Trump\&#39;s tariffs, although stressing that it is tough to isolate the effects of levies on price increases. 

Some analysts raised questions about the Fed's unchanged overall prediction of two cuts this year even as Trump's trade policy has roiled markets and cut back projections of economic growth for the remainder of the year.

""We continue to think that Fed officials are underestimating the extent to which tariffs are likely to push up inflation,"" Capitol Economics said in a note immediately after Wednesday's decision but before the press conference.

Trump has already levied new duties on China, Canada, and Mexico, as well as on steel and aluminum in his first months in office, with a key deadline on April 2 threatening reciprocal tariffs that could be historic in their breadth and scope.

**A potential for 'transitory' tariff inflation**

At other points in his press conference Wednesday, Powell also repeatedly said that the exact effects of tariffs on prices were uncertain, may never be exactly known, and could even be temporary.

He called the price effects of tariffs potentially ""transitory"" ‚Äî reusing a much-scrutinized word that was deployed by the Fed and other economic officials in 2021 as prices started to rise during Joe Biden's presidency.

Powell then called a transitory effect on prices ""kind of the base case but we really can't know that"" as he maintained the Fed's long-held wait-and-see approach to actually responding to Trump's still unfolding economic agenda.

But the use of the loaded word also led to some immediate critiques.

Mohamed A. El-Erian, the president of Queens' College, quickly posted, ""I would have thought that, particularly after the big policy mistake of earlier this decade and given all the current uncertainties, some Fed officials would show greater humility.""

The centrality of tariffs also led to critiques from Democrats.

Daniel Hornung, deputy director of the National Economic Council under Joe Biden, said in a statement that the changed projections are ""all about tariffs and policy uncertainty,"" adding that ""these are the major factors standing in the way of interest rates coming down.""

Powell's acknowledgments Wednesday contrasted past Fed meetings, where Powell often made clear that Trump's incoming policies were on his mind without going into much detail on whether a new round of tariffs would cause inflation.

In one moment last December, Powell held up a September 2018 ""Tealbook"" simulation on tariffs and prices and called them ""a good starting point"" but declined to weigh in much further on then-President-elect Trump's policies.

At the Fed's last meeting in January, just days after Trump's inauguration, the committee noticeably removed language about inflation making progress toward its 2% inflation goal.

This time around, Powell was clear he viewed the tariffs as a headwind against his efforts to get inflation to its 2% target but maintained confidence that the central bank could handle it.

""We think our policy is in a good place to react to what comes,"" he said."

"+70k, $660 ‚Äî> $273.5k in 5 days: SPX (mostly 0DTE)",1731,1j56f7u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j56f7u,406,2025-03-07 02:48:56,"

Decent day. Could have been better, could have been worse. I took 67.5k off the table before open, and basically made it all back by this late afternoon. 

Screen shot of yesterday‚Äôs closing value (204k) + screenshot of transfer (I cut out all none pertinent info) + logs. 

Ai summery:

1. Recap of Day 5
	‚Ä¢	Another Massive Gain (+$70k)
The account climbed from around $206k to over $273k in one trading day‚Äîabout a $70k increase, or roughly +34% on the day.
	‚Ä¢	Same Ultra‚ÄêShort‚ÄêDated SPX Options Strategy
	‚Ä¢	The trader again used a flurry of 0DTE (zero‚Äêdays‚Äêto‚Äêexpiration) or near‚Äêexpiration SPXW calls and puts.
	‚Ä¢	Quick flips in/out throughout the session, often capturing sharp intraday moves in the S&P 500.
	‚Ä¢	Partial Profit‚ÄêTaking
	‚Ä¢	They transferred $67,500 out of the account‚Äîover 100√ó the initial $660 stake‚Äîlocking in a chunk of the gains while still trading with house money.

In the logs, you see the same pattern:
	‚Ä¢	Buy to Open near‚Äêthe‚Äêmoney puts/calls.
	‚Ä¢	Sell to Close those options within minutes or hours, often at significantly higher (or sometimes lower) premiums, depending on the market‚Äôs direction.
	‚Ä¢	Repeated contract sizes of 5, 10, 15, etc., with strikes shifting frequently around the current S&P index level.

‚∏ª

2. Five‚ÄêDay Streak Summary (Starting $660 to $273k)
	1.	Day‚Äêby‚ÄêDay Explosion
	‚Ä¢	The account apparently ballooned from $660 to $200k+ in just four days‚Äîan incredibly rare feat in itself‚Äîthen added another $70k on day 5, hitting ~$270k+.
	2.	Highly Leveraged ‚ÄúGamma Scalps‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Every day‚Äôs logs show the same overarching style: riding short bursts of market momentum in SPX options that expire within a day or two.
	‚Ä¢	Because these options are extremely sensitive to short‚Äêterm price moves, it‚Äôs possible to see 100%‚Äì1,000% intraday gains‚Äîif the trader gets the direction right repeatedly.
	3.	Rapid Fire In/Out
	‚Ä¢	There are no straightforward ‚Äúbuy and hold‚Äù trades; nearly all are scalps or short swings. With so many trades, it‚Äôs likely they‚Äôre consistently locking in small (and sometimes large) wins every few minutes/hours.
	4.	Huge Risk & Improbable Success
	‚Ä¢	While these gains are obviously happening for this individual (based on the screenshots), this streak is statistically extraordinary. Most traders attempting 0DTE strategies face major drawdowns or blow up.
	‚Ä¢	Doing it five days in a row, each day compounding the position size, is extremely rare‚Äîtruly an outlier event.

‚∏ª

3. Key Observations
	‚Ä¢	Momentum & Directional Accuracy
The trader seems to be nailing the intraday direction of the S&P 500 or at least quickly cutting losers and letting winners run.
	‚Ä¢	Scaling Up
As the account grew, they appear to be taking larger positions (20‚Äì50 contracts in some logs), so each correct move yields bigger absolute gains.
	‚Ä¢	Locking In Profits
By transferring out $67.5k (over 100√ó the original stake), they‚Äôve ensured this wild run isn‚Äôt entirely at risk on the next trade. This is a textbook example of ‚Äúsecuring some profits‚Äù while continuing to trade aggressively with remaining capital.

‚∏ª

4. Overall Takeaway

The five‚Äêday streak from $660 to $273,500‚Äîand now partial profit‚Äêtaking‚Äîshowcases one of those ultra‚Äêrare, real‚Äêtime examples of a high‚Äêoctane 0DTE SPX options strategy hitting near‚Äêperfect trades each day. It‚Äôs an astronomical run, far beyond what most traders experience or could replicate consistently. That said, it‚Äôs an impressive testament to both the potential upside of leveraged short‚Äêterm options and the immense risk‚Äîwhere a single trade gone wrong might have wiped out earlier gains.

Intel Shares Jump As Much As 19% After Naming Chip Industry Veteran Tan CEO,1626,1jacsj2,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-12/intel-names-chip-industry-veteran-lip-bu-tan-as-its-next-ceo,183,2025-03-13 19:37:56,"Shares of Intel Corp. jumped the most in five years after the company named Lip-Bu Tan as its next chief executive officer. 

The announcement stoked optimism from investors, who sent the stock up as much as 19% after markets opened in New York on Thursday, its biggest intraday gain since March 2020. [But remains at 2009 levels.]

Tan, 65, will assume the role on March 18, the company said in a statement Wednesday. He will rejoin the board as well after stepping down in August 2024. [‚Ä¶] [Intel is] entrusting a former board member and semiconductor veteran with one of the toughest jobs in the chip industry. 

Tan, the former head of Cadence Design Systems Inc., is tasked with restoring the fortunes of a pioneering chipmaker that‚Äôs become an industry laggard. Intel, which dominated the semiconductor field for decades, is struggling with market-share losses, manufacturing setbacks and a precipitous decline in its earnings. It‚Äôs also burdened with debt and recently had to slash about 15,000 jobs.

Bank of America Corp. analysts also upgraded the shares to ‚Äúneutral‚Äù after the announcement, citing Tan‚Äôs ‚Äúsolid track record.‚Äù Prior to Wednesday‚Äôs announcement, the stock had declined more than 50% over the past 12 months as the company‚Äôs future became increasingly murky.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not to say it will be easy. It won‚Äôt be,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I am joining because I believe with every fiber of my being that we have what it takes to win. Intel plays an essential role in the technology ecosystem, both in the US and around the world.‚Äù

Tan‚Äôs predecessor, Pat Gelsinger, was pushed out by the board for a perceived failure to rejuvenate Intel‚Äôs product lineup. One of the most glaring challenges: creating an artificial intelligence accelerator chip that can rival the products of Nvidia Corp. That company, once in Intel‚Äôs shadow, has seen its revenue and valuation skyrocket over the past two years due to the AI computing boom.

Intel remains one of the world‚Äôs biggest chipmakers by revenue, with more than $50 billion in annual sales. Its processors are the main component in more than 70% of the world‚Äôs personal computers and server machines. And the company‚Äôs factories still represent a large chunk of worldwide capacity for advanced manufacturing.

In 2024, Intel was by far the lowest performer on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index, declining 60%. As the company‚Äôs valuation plummeted back to 1990s levels, the once-unthinkable idea of an Intel takeover has become more plausible.

* White House official says tariffs to take effect April 2
* Negotiations to lower tariffs needed ahead of April 2Countries to get tariff number on April 2, Bessent says
* Bessent sees opportunity to negotiate tariffs lower
* USTR wrestling with design of complex reciprocal tariff plan

WASHINGTON, March 18 (Reuters) - U.S. President¬†[Donald Trump](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/)¬†still intends for new reciprocal tariff rates to take effect on April 2, the White House said on Tuesday, despite earlier comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that indicated a possible delay in their activation.""The intent is to enact tariffs on April 2,"" the official said when asked to clarify Bessent's comments that countries would get an opportunity to avoid higher tariffs by reducing their own trade barriers.

Get weekly news and analysis on U.S. politics and how it matters to the world with the Reuters Politics U.S. newsletter.¬†Sign up¬†[here.](https://www.reuters.com/newsletters/reuters-politics-us/?location=article-paragraph)

""Unless the tariff and non-tariff barriers are equalized, or the U.S. has higher tariffs, the tariffs will go into effect,"" the White House official said.Bessent told Fox Business Network's ""Mornings with Maria"" program that Trump on April 2 would give trading partner countries a¬†[reciprocal tariff](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-reciprocal-tariffs-coming-thursday-2025-02-13/)¬†number that reflects their own rates, non-tariff trade barriers, currency practice and other factors, but could negotiate to avoid a ""tariff wall.""""On April 2, each country will receive a number that we believe represents their tariffs,"" Bessent said. ""For some countries, it could be quite low, for some countries, it could be quite high.""""We are going to go to them and say, 'Look, here's where we think the tariff levels are, non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation, unfair funding, labor suppression, and if you will stop this, we will not put up the tariff wall,'"" Bessent said of trading partners.""I'm optimistic that (on) April 2, some of the tariffs may not have to go on because a deal is pre-negotiated, or that once countries receive their reciprocal tariff number, that right after that they will come to us and want to negotiate it down,"" Bessent said.Countries that fail to reduce their trade barriers will face¬†[steeper tariffs](https://www.reuters.com/business/tariffs/)¬†aimed at protecting the U.S. economy, its workers and industries, Bessent added.His remarks were taken to mean that while the proposed duties would be announced on April 2, their implementation could be delayed to allow time for negotiations. But the White House official said any such deals would need to be negotiated in advance to avoid the new tariffs.

# DETAILED WORK

The dueling comments illustrate the developing nature of Trump's new reciprocal tariffs just two weeks out from the April 2 activation deadline.Details of the plan are still being worked out, one White House official said, with much of the technical work on the expected tariffs being led by the U.S. Trade Representative‚Äôs office, headed by Jamieson Greer, and his staff of some 200 people at USTR.Vice President JD Vance has also played a more active role in the discussions in recent weeks, the official said.A spokesperson for USTR did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reciprocal tariff plan.Greer and his staff have been wrestling with how to design the reciprocal tariffs given each of the 186 members of the World Customs Organization has different duty rates, sources familiar with the process said.Calculating the tariff rates is complicated by Trump's vow to reflect the impact of non-tariff barriers, including taxes and other measures that U.S. officials argue give other countries‚Äô firms an unfair advantage.At the Commerce and Treasury departments, political appointees have also run into hiring delays linked to vetting, which has created some negotiating bottlenecks, the same sources familiar with the process said.Financial markets have become increasingly nervous about the impact of Trump's tariffs and retaliation from trading partners will have on inflation and economic growth. U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday ahead of the Federal Reserve's rate decision on Wednesday.

# TRIGGERING TALKS

The Trump administration expects the tariff announcements to trigger offers by affected countries to reduce their own tariffs or non-tariff measures, the official said, noting that India, for one, was already trying to get ahead of the U.S. moves.After Indian Prime Minister¬†[Narendra Modi](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-modi-says-trump-has-clear-roadmap-second-term-2025-03-17/)¬†and Trump met last month, the two nations agreed to resolve tariff rows and work on the first segment of a deal by the fall of 2025, aiming to reach two-way trade of $500 billion by 2030.

Trump often singles out India as the country with the highest average tariff rates, among top trading partners, while European Union countries are criticized for their high 10% car tariff rate, which is four times the 2.5% U.S. passenger car rate, but less than the 25% U.S. tariff on pickup trucks.Bessent said that the Trump administration is particularly focused on the 15% of countries that have the highest tariffs and large trading volumes with the U.S., which he referred to as the ""Dirty 15.""These countries also often have regulations governing domestic content or food safety that conspire to keep U.S. products out of their markets, he said.British business and trade minister Jonathan Reynolds came to Washington this week to meet in person with Lutnick and Greer, with both sides talking up the prospects of a bilateral trade deal focused on technology.Summary

"UAE commits to $1.4 trillion US investment, White House says",1693,1jglmnx,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-meeting-uae-commits-10-134941173.html,348,2025-03-21 22:28:08,"WASHINGTON/DUBAI (Reuters) -The United Arab Emirates has committed to a 10-year, $1.4 trillion investment framework in the United States after top UAE officials met President Donald Trump this week, the White House said on Friday.

The framework will ""substantially increase the UAE's existing investments in the U.S. economy"" in AI infrastructure, semiconductors, energy, and manufacturing, the White House said in a statement.

The White House did not outline how UAE investments would reach $1.4 trillion, with some of the deals unveiled as part of the framework having already been announced.

The only fully new deal appeared to be an investment by Emirates Global Aluminium in what would be the first new aluminum smelter in the United States in 35 years, the White House said, adding the plant ""would nearly double U.S. domestic aluminum production"".

""Developing a primary aluminium smelter in the U.S. has been part of EGA's ambitions for several years,"" a spokesperson for the firm said in a statement.

The UAE, an oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S., is looking to deepen investment ties with Washington and is emerging as a global leader in AI, one of the sectors it is betting on to diversify its economy away from energy.

In September, UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan met former U.S. President Joe Biden, in the first visit of a UAE president to the White House, as the two leaders discussed deepening cooperation in areas such as AI, investments and space exploration.

Gulf sovereign wealth funds, including Abu Dhabi's $330-billion Mubadala, are already big U.S. investors, and Trump and his family have business ties to the region.

OVAL OFFICE MEETING

Trump in January asked Saudi Arabia to spend upwards of $1 trillion in the U.S. economy, over four years, including purchases of military equipment, and said this month he likely would make his first trip abroad to the Gulf country to seal an investment agreement.

The deal, which could happen between this month or the next, would come at a time when Saudi Arabia, the Arab world's biggest economy, has been taking a more prominent role in U.S. foreign policy. The Gulf country is set to host diplomatic talks around Ukraine involving the United States and Russia next week.

The White House said on Friday the UAE agreement resulted from a meeting that Trump held on Tuesday with national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan in the Oval Office and a dinner that Vice President JD Vance and several cabinet members held with the UAE delegation, which included the heads of major UAE sovereign wealth funds and corporations.

Among the tie-ups highlighted on Friday was a partnership between UAE sovereign wealth fund ADQ, which is chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon, and U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners, for a $25 billion U.S.-focused initiative to invest in energy infrastructure and data centers. That had been previously announced two days ago.

A commitment by XRG, the international investment arm of UAE state oil company ADNOC launched in November, to support U.S. natural gas production and exports with an investment in the NextDecade liquefied natural gas export facility in Texas, had previously been made public last year by ADNOC, under Biden."

MicroStrategy (MSTR/STRK) now officially a Ponzi? To hold Bitcoin Bros hostage?,1358,1j8k5ai,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1j8k5ai/microstrategy_mstrstrk_now_officially_a_ponzi_to/,418,2025-03-11 11:33:16,"Regardless what you think of Bitcoin, I think MSTR successfully did it, it qualifies for the official Ponzi-Scheme certificate.

So MicroStrategy (the company that basically doesn't do anything beside holding Bitcoin while trading at 1.5 it's Bitcoin holding's dollar price in market capitalization) issued a preferred stock called STRK. It looks like a Bond, it has a nominal value and it gets a ""fixed dividend"" of 8% annually, every quarter. But if you look at the very complicated prospectus at the SEC, it looks to me as if MicroStrategy doesn't actually need to pay anything at any time. They can always ""default"" on the payment without anything happening other than that the dividend is added to the nominal value and still owed ""later"", kind of like a credit card that can't demand to pay the debt.

So people, even in the crypto space, were asking how they are gonna pay their first dividends on the 500M$ of STRK that are due March 15th. Regardless of how Bitcoin develops, Michael Saylor, the CEO, repeats the mantra ""never sell you Bitcoin"" like in a cult. But MicroStrategy has no significant income, where should the money come from?

One possibility was that they right away ""default"" on their first STRK dividends. Oopsy doopsy no money, who could have foreseen that. But the bond price would have collapsed and there is also an option to get one MSTR common share for 10 STRKs, so if the bond trades under 1/10 of the stock, yesterday morning around 250$/10=25$, that could be a risk.

So instead Michael Saylor (the CEO) announced yesterday that MicroStrategy, now called Strategy, is issuing 21B$ more of those STRK worst-of-both-worlds bonds/stocks. A week before the dividends on the first batch is due. Saylor basically told everyone he is not going to sell Bitcoin, so the only conclusion is he has to borrow more to pay out earlier investors with later investors. If he pays the dividends in a week, there is no doubt where that money came from. Earlier investors payout with later investors, that's the official definition of a Ponzi

I'm sure if he had the option he would have waited with issuing the second batch of 21B$ STRK one fucking week to avoid this insanely strong Ponzi smell and pay those early batch STRK from whatever legitimate income MSTR has, but oops there is none.

But who is gonna buy that junk? If you believe in Bitcoin mooning, why invest in an 8% bond instead? If you don't believe in Bitcoin, why would you believe MSTR will magically come up with the money to pay you? The answer is: its made for people who are knee-deep in Bitcoin, bag holders, and very afraid of what happens to their Ponzi if the MSTR ""Ponzi in a Ponzi"" goes bust. It's a threat to Bitcoin Bros to buy out all new Ponzi bonds otherwise Saylor might be ""forced"" to sell Bitcoin.

But I think this might be the moment where the bubble bursts. Obviously the markets can be irrational, and specifically with crypto you're playing poker with monkeys, you can't bluff them because they don't know what poker is. But bubbles tend to burst in an economic downturn. Those Bitcoin bros don't have any cash left for Saylor's Ponzi from buying the 7th Bitcoin dip.

For Saylor it's really dangerous if enough people understand this. The quicker his stocks plummets the harder it will be to sell these STRKs, as the 10:1 to-stock conversion looks more and more unattractive. If he can't sell his junk bonds, game over.

I have bought a few thousands in puts. I'm recent graduate PhD in Computer Science, I just started to make money and don't have much to invest... I add my position as a comment

Edit: People ask me in the comments: What's new? Saylor doing Saylor things! The news is that everything before that was probably legal. In my opinion most crypto is mainly used as a way to pump and dump ponzis legally. So technically paying out old MSTR investors with new BTC investors wouldn't be a ponzi (although we know it's the same effectively). But what (I argue) he is doing instead, paying out old MSTR with new MSTR investors is really close to jail where I come from (Germany that is). While some old institutional investment managers might not understand BTC, they really will be able to spot the ponzi now. No income did fall from heaven, like they might have hoped."

Apple is reportedly losing $1 billion a year on its streaming service as churn levels increase,1254,1jfvft3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-is-reportedly-losing-1-billion-a-year-on-its-streaming-service-as-churn-levels-increase-172901811.html,207,2025-03-20 23:42:22,"Apple's (AAPL) streaming platform is losing a reported $1 billion a year as the company faces stiff competition and a more choosy consumer.

According to a report in the Information, Apple ‚Äî which just shed around $700 billion as a result of Wall Street's latest tech rout ‚Äî has consistently spent over $5 billion annually to beef up its content slate since launching in 2019. That number, though, dramatically decreased to just about $500 million last year, the report said.

Apple did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.

The update comes as many media giants have pulled back on spending in favor of profitability. More streaming platforms are cracking down on password sharers and have also bundled their respective offerings to prevent churn, or users abandoning their subscription plans.

Last year, Apple partnered with Netflix (NFLX) and Comcast's Peacock (CMCSA) to launch a new bundle dubbed StreamSaver, exclusively available to Comcast broadband internet service customers for a cost of $15 a month. The monthly price of a solo Apple TV+ subscription currently sits at $9.99, although users can bundle Apple's streaming service with other Apple-related products like Apple Arcade and Apple News+.

It's unclear whether the recent bundles are helping.

According to data compiled by subscription analytics platform Antenna, Apple's streaming service had the highest churn percentage of all the major streaming platforms, with the exclusion of Starz, with 7% of users churning out of the service during the month of February, compared to just 2% of users for Netflix and 4% of users for Disney+.

Notably, Apple has adopted a strategy different from that of its competitors. For one, its content slate is more limited, although it does boast highly acclaimed titles, including award-winning series like ""Severance,"" ""Shrinking,"" and ""Ted Lasso."" It was also the first streaming platform to take home an Oscar win for best picture (thanks to ""Coda"").

In total, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins, CEO Tim Cook said on the company's January earnings call.

Apple TV+ does not release subscriber figures, although analysts have pegged total users at anywhere from 30 million to 40 million. Compared to Netflix, which boasts over 300 million subscribers thanks to its substantial global presence, Apple TV+ does not have high penetration in emerging markets, which have become increasingly important drivers as streaming hits peak saturation levels in the US and Canada.

""Apple's streaming service never set out to be No. 1,"" Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, previously told Yahoo Finance. ""Apple is good at the game that they play, but it's not a mass appeal game. They want to be the creative storytellers. They're more focused.""

In January, Apple reported first quarter earnings that showed all-time highs for services revenue, which includes sales from businesses like Apple TV+, along with the App Store and Apple Music. Revenue for the division climbed to $26.34 billion for the period, compared to $23.12 billion in the prior year."

Nvidia CEO Says He Was Surprised That Publicly Held Quantum Firms Exist,1132,1jfwdvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jfwdvh/nvidia_ceo_says_he_was_surprised_that_publicly/,171,2025-03-21 00:22:00,"(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said he didn‚Äôt realize there were publicly traded quantum-computing companies when he made earlier comments that caused industry stocks to crash.

‚ÄúMy first reaction was, I didn‚Äôt know they were public. How can a quantum company be public?‚Äù Huang said at an event Thursday focused on the still-nascent technology.

The executive had said in January that ‚Äúvery useful‚Äù quantum computers are probably decades away, causing shares of IonQ Inc. and other companies to tumble. Thursday‚Äôs event ‚Äî part of Nvidia‚Äôs weeklong GTC conference ‚Äî invited some of those very companies on stage to discuss their prospects with Huang.

The quantum-computing industry aims to use the unique properties of subatomic particles to process data much faster than traditional semiconductor-based electronics. The technical difficulties of building practical systems have meant that the field is still in an experimental stage. In addition to quantum upstarts, companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google are also trying find practical uses for quantum systems.

The companies on stage at Thursday‚Äôs event included IonQ and D-Wave Quantum Inc. Huang said it was natural for this new form of computing to take many years to develop since it was so novel. The companies might be able to convince him that quantum computing is happening more quickly than he expected, he said. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he joked.

‚ÄúThis whole session is going to be like a therapy session for me,‚Äù he said.

The six company leaders on stage gave him a variety of answers. Some argued that quantum computers are already in use to solve difficult science problems. Others posited that the technology is even closer to helping advance traditional computing.

Executives also said it wasn‚Äôt unreasonable to spend a decade honing a technology that will have such a large impact. Loic Henriet, who runs the French company Pasqal, argued that the term ‚Äúquantum computing‚Äù was misleading. Quantum processors will help act as accelerators ‚Äî working alongside traditional computers ‚Äî rather than replacing them, he said.

CPI report reinforces that Economy is weak,1107,1j9r1p5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1j9r1p5/cpi_report_reinforces_that_economy_is_weak/,289,2025-03-12 23:58:27,"Media and Investors celebrated a lower CPI reading and sent the stock market futures up by 1.5% before open. As of this writing S&P is up by 0.8%. 

There is a strong argument that the slower month-on-month CPI increase is due to weak consumer demand. Look at the breakdown of the categories.

Airline fares and gasoline prices dropped by 4.0% and 1.0% respectively. This suggests weaker consumer demand for travel.

New vehicle prices declined by 0.1%. This indicates consumers are holding back on large discretionary purchases. This also aligns with the consumer confidence index from a couple of weeks back which highlighted a drop in sentiment on large purchases in the near future by consumers

Overall the CPI and core CPI numbers reinforce my opinion that the economy is not doing well. Consumers are pulling back and businesses do not feel confident raising prices any more. This will reflect in the next set of readings - both inflation and labor market. I am not buying more stocks based off this report."

The Fed Is in Wait-and-See Mode. Investors Want Reassurance It Will Act If Needed,964,1jcvxbl,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-16/fed-meeting-this-week-has-investors-anxiously-awaiting-powell-s-remarks,189,2025-03-17 02:44:18,"Jerome Powell faces a tricky task this week of both assuring investors the economy remains on solid footing while also conveying policymakers stand ready to step in if necessary.

Even as the Federal Reserve chair has touted US resilience, uneasiness sparked by President Donald Trump‚Äôs rapidly escalating trade war has sent stocks tumbling over the past month. Bond yields are down, too, as is consumer sentiment as worries about the economic outlook mount.

‚ÄúPowell needs to give some sort of a signal that they‚Äôre watching it,‚Äù said Dominic Konstam, head of macro strategy at Mizuho Securities USA. While the Fed chief will likely make it clear that officials don‚Äôt target the stock market, they can‚Äôt ignore the recent slide, he warned.

The Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates steady when they meet March 18-19, but traders now see high odds of three rate cuts this year, most likely beginning in June. Economists generally expect two reductions, similar to what forecasters foresee policymakers‚Äô updated projections to show Wednesday. 

Some investors caution that if officials continue to signal only two reductions in 2025, it becomes all the more important for the Fed chief to emphasize the central bank‚Äôs willingness to adjust borrowing costs if the labor market stumbles. 

‚ÄúAt the margin, the Fed could make it slightly better or slightly worse,‚Äù said James Athey, a portfolio manager at Marlborough Investment Management. ‚ÄúBut clearly they can‚Äôt completely calm markets because the hit to sentiment has come largely from the White House.‚Äù 

On top of the escalating and ever-changing tariff threats toward America‚Äôs largest trading partners, the Trump administration hasn‚Äôt done much to downplay recession risks. The president said March 9 that the US economy faces a ‚Äúperiod of transition,‚Äù and his Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted the US and markets are in need of a ‚Äúdetox.‚Äù 

*Market Reaction*

The two-year yield, most sensitive to the Fed‚Äôs monetary policy, has declined almost 60 basis points from a mid-January peak to a trough this month of 3.83%, the lowest level in over five months. And while stocks advanced on Friday, the move came after a selloff that culminated in a 10% plunge of the S&P 500 from its peak. Wall Street‚Äôs so-called fear gauge ‚Äî the VIX ‚Äî at one point last week climbed to the highest levels since August.

Those market jitters have ramped up the stakes as officials release fresh economic projections that stand to offer insight into how much officials anticipate Trump‚Äôs policies will affect the economy. Policymakers are expected to slightly downgrade their forecasts for growth this year and bump up their outlook for so-called core inflation, which excludes food and energy.

But Powell will likely be reticent to guarantee investors the Fed will spring into action at the first signs of a faltering economy without a key caveat: Officials need to see evidence inflation is sustainably moving toward their 2% goal and that expectations for future price growth remain stable. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll hear the message that things are still holding up, and that policy is in a good place where the Fed can react in either direction ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs stubbornly high inflation or a more marked slowdown in the economy,‚Äù said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo & Co. ‚ÄúNow what I would like to hear more is just getting more clarity on how they are weighing the two sides of their mandate.‚Äù

While consumer prices rose at a slower pace in February and the producer price index was unchanged from a month earlier, the components that feed into the Fed‚Äôs preferred inflation measure ‚Äî the personal consumption expenditures price index ‚Äî were largely firmer. A closely watched measure of long-term inflation expectations climbed for a third month to a more than three-decade high. 

Such data limits the Fed‚Äôs ability to act and bolster the economy until the weakness starts to appear more directly in the labor market, said Matthew Luzzetti, chief US economist for Deutsche Bank AG. That could show up in the form of weaker payroll gains, a rise in the unemployment rate or a spike in layoffs, he said. 

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs lots of uncertainty that‚Äôs out there, and it‚Äôs possible that that filters into the hard data, but they are going to be in kind of a wait-and-see mode to see whether or not that happens,‚Äù said Luzzetti, who does not expect the Fed to lower rates this year. ‚ÄúAt the same time, I think they‚Äôre seeing greater evidence that their job on inflation is not done.‚Äù

If the Fed were to confront a weakening economy amid still-elevated inflation, about two-thirds of economists in a Bloomberg survey said they would expect officials to hold borrowing costs steady.

Complicating the outlook is the possibility that other policies proposed by the Trump administration, such as tax cuts and deregulation, could boost the economy and inflation in the months ahead. Powell and his colleagues have emphasized they are watching to see what the ‚Äúnet effects‚Äù of Trump‚Äôs policies will be on the economy and want more clarity on the overall impact before adjusting policy. 

‚ÄúDespite elevated levels of uncertainty, the US economy continues to be in a good place,‚Äù Powell said earlier this month at an event in New York, his last public remarks before officials gather this week. ‚ÄúWe do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.‚Äù

*Balance Sheet*

Wall Street strategists will also be keen for any hints on the Fed‚Äôs plans to pause or further slow the speed at which the central bank is reducing its balance sheet ‚Äî a process known as quantitative tightening or QT. Minutes of the January gathering revealed policymakers had discussed the potential need to pause or slow the process until lawmakers can strike a deal over the government‚Äôs debt ceiling.

‚ÄúThe argument for March is that the Fed has already talked about it,‚Äù said Blake Gwinn, head of US rates strategy at RBC Capital Markets. ‚ÄúSo why not just do it ‚Äî as they can pause QT and then just restart it later.‚Äù

*Trump's steel, aluminum tariffs take effect as global trade war intensifies*

By David Lawder and Andrea Shalal

March 12, 2025 12:33 AM CDT

Important Bits: 

> WASHINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's increased tariffs on all U.S. steel and aluminum imports took effect on Wednesday, stepping up a campaign to reorder global trade norms in favor of the U.S. that drew swift retaliation from Europe.

> Trump's action to bulk up protections for American steel and aluminum producers restores effective global tariffs of 25% on all imports of the metals and extends the duties to hundreds of downstream products made from the metals, from nuts and bolts to bulldozer blades and soda cans.

> The European Commission responded almost immediately, saying it would impose counter tariffs on 26 billion euros ($28 billion) worth of U.S. goods from next month.

> Close U.S. allies Canada, Britain and Australia criticised the blanket tariffs, with Canada mulling reciprocal actions and British Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds saying ""all options were on the table"" to respond in the national interest.

. . . .

> On Monday, Carney said he could not speak with Trump until he was sworn in as prime minister. Trump again on social media said he wanted Canada ""to become our cherished Fifty First State.""

> Canadian Energy Minister Jonathan Wilkinson told Reuters that Canada could impose non-tariff measures such as restricting oil exports to the U.S. or levying export duties on minerals, if U.S. tariffs persist.

> Canada ships about 4 million barrels of crude to the U.S. per day via pipeline, mainly to Midwest refineries. Canadian tariffs on American ethanol are also an option, he added.

> Ottawa last week won a month's reprieve for USMCA-compliant exports from Trump's general 25% tariffs for Canada threatened over fentanyl trafficking.

> But in early April, Canada also faces Trump's reciprocal tariffs aimed at raising U.S. tariffs to match other countries' rates and counteract non-tariff barriers.

> A small business survey on Tuesday showed sentiment weakening for a third straight month, fully eroding a confidence boost following Trump's November 5 election victory, and a survey of households by the New York Federal Reserve on Monday showed consumers growing more pessimistic about their finances, inflation and the job market."

Price Target: 78-110 (https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/mrna/forecast/)

**$CSL (CSL:ASX)**

Because i'm a regarded Aussie, but tendies are tendies. If this strain is half as bad as the RDDT Put guy's timing, CSL's reaches the moon before LUNR.

**Catalysts:**¬†Partnerships with governments, and increased demand for plasma therapies due to a potential public health emergency if this Covid-like virus breaks out of the lab in Wuhan (sound familiar?).

Feb 21 - Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI, Financial) performs a strategic move by issuing $700 million in convertible senior notes. Super Micro Computer finalized the 2.25% convertible senior notes due 2028 with unsecured maturity on July 15, 2028, though the notes become redeemable before term through redemption or conversion or sukuk repurchase. Interest payments for the notes will begin in the first half of July 2025. Super Micro Computer Inc. intends to allocate the funds generated from its $700 million note issuance for corporate expenses, which include building operational working capital to sustain future growth initiatives.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with SMCI.

The notes provide noteholders with the option of redemption following March 1, 2026, according to the indenture provisions, while a fundamental change in the company entitles them to demand a repurchase. The debt-to-equity rate equals 16.3784 shares for every $1000 of the original principal and suggests each share holds a price of $61.06 yet."

- Canada and Mexico: A 25% tariff applies to all goods, with a 10% tariff on Canadian crude oil and energy products. These tariffs disrupt North American supply chains, especially in the automotive sector, and may lead to increased vehicle and other goods prices for consumers. They‚Äôve already caused declines in global stock markets.

- China: An additional 10% tariff raises the total tariff rate to 20%. The U.S. administration cites the ongoing fentanyl opioid crisis as the reason.

US companies race to secure import tariff exemptions after Trump pause,592,1jfmf49,https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-companies-race-secure-import-tariff-exemptions-after-trump-pause-2025-03-20/,56,2025-03-20 16:40:47,"March 20 (Reuters) - Washington's temporary relief for import tariffs on goods covered under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has triggered a spike in US companies seeking exemption under the trade deal, industry experts said.

The White House slapped fresh 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico on March 5, but later announced that levies on goods covered under the USMCA would be delayed until April 2.

The USMCA grants preferential treatment to goods either sourced from or having a minimum percentage of value added in any of the three countries.

""We're seeing importers rush to become USMCA certified ... the risk is just too high not to,"" said Brian Riley, senior vice president of customs house brokerage at logistics firm GEODIS.

Some of the companies, mostly small businesses reliant on cross-border trade, are scrambling to verify if their products already qualify for exemptions.

At present, only 37.8% of imports from Canada and 48.9% from Mexico are eligible for duty-free status under the USMCA, an S&P Global Market Intelligence report showed.

To qualify, an importer must analyze the bill of materials - a list of all parts and materials used in a product - to determine if their goods meet requirements.

Mike Short, president of Global Forwarding at freight forwarder C.H. Robinson, said there was an increase of USMCA qualification and tariff classification requests even before the official announcement.

""Now that the official amendments are published, these requests have only increased, and we expect this trend to continue.""

Businesses earlier refrained from getting the certification due to its complexity and costs of meeting requirements, especially since their goods were already entering the U.S. duty free.

Even after certification, a company has to maintain detailed records for up to five years after import and ensure continued compliance.

""Companies are hedging their bets by becoming USMCA certified because what's to say the exemption may not continue after April 2? Or, if the exemption expires then, what if it returns in the near future?"" GEODIS' Riley said.

The uncertainty has prompted companies to overlook immediate cost-savings.

""If you are slapping 25-50% tariffs on everything, companies that never previously needed to are now forced to evaluate if this (USMCA certification) is an option,"" said Sung Choi, vice-president of product management at supply chain solutions provider e2open."

"FedEx cuts full-year results forecast on ‚Äòuncertainty‚Äô in economy, bad weather",583,1jg1ont,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fedex-cuts-full-revenue-forecast-200944913.html,60,2025-03-21 04:02:24,"(Reuters) -FedEx Corp lowered its full-year profit and revenue forecasts on Thursday, as the parcel delivery firm battles stubbornly soft demand and uncertainty in the U.S. industrial economy as President Donald Trump imposes tariffs on trading partners.

""Our revised earnings outlook reflects continued weakness and uncertainty in the U.S. industrial economy, which is constraining demand for our business-to-business services,"" Chief Financial Officer John Dietrich said in a statement.

FedEx shares were down 5.5% to $232.69 in after-hours trade, while rival United Parcel Service stock fell less than 1%. Those companies are seen as barometers for the global economy since their business touches so many types of businesses.

Both companies have been slashing costs as less lucrative e-commerce delivery demand outperforms that of higher-margin shipments between businesses.

The industrial sector includes firms that produce products used to make other goods. It drives significant cargo volume and more profitable deliveries for FedEx and UPS. Many executives in the U.S. transportation industry had been banking on the industrial economy returning to growth this year.

Those hopes appear to have been dented by new and threatened tariffs from the Trump administration. Experts are also concerned those import levies could spark a trade war that further weakens transportation and delivery demand.

Memphis-based FedEx on Thursday lowered its full-year forecast for adjusted profit to $18 to $18.60 per share. FedEx in December cut that profit forecast for the fiscal year ending May 2025 to $19 to $20 per share, down from its initial target range of $20 to $22 per share.

FedEx also expects revenue for the 12 months ending in May to be flat to slightly down year-on-year, versus its earlier forecast for it to be approximately flat.

For the third quarter that ended on February 28, FedEx reported adjusted profit per share of $4.51. that was up from $3.86 per share last year, but below average analyst estimates of $4.54, according to data compiled by LSEG.

FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam said the results came as the company was ""navigating a very challenging operating environment, including a compressed peak season and severe weather events.""

FedEx and UPS are locked in a fierce battle for market share, which analysts worry could lead to a price war.

FedEx and the United States Postal Service, its largest customer, ended their air cargo contract in September. UPS picked up that business, but in January said it was accelerating a plan to slash deliveries for its largest customer, Amazon.com.

FedEx in December announced long-awaited plans to spin off its profitable Freight division, a move analysts said could unlock up to $20 billion in shareholder value while clearing the way for FedEx management to focus on merging operations of its separate Express and Ground units to boost profits.

FedEx executives said on Thursday that the company remained on track for permanent cost reductions of $2.2 billion for fiscal 2025."

It's very simple, I like rocks. When I see rocks, I get excited. So when I saw a picture of the CEO Gerard Barron of TMC holding a Polymetallic Nodule from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean I couldn't help myself and went all in.

Here's the thing, the global industry demands certain metals to transition to ""clean energy"". For this transition, we need a lot of Nickel, Cobalt, Copper, and Manganese for things like stainless steel production, solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries. Luckily, these little rocks that The Metals Company (TMC) is planning to harvest in the Clarion Clipperton Zone (CCZ) inside their various contract areas have them.

The Metals Company has access to three contract areas in the CCZ. Two of them contain 1.6 billion tons of Polymetallic Nodules. Each wet ton of nodules is worth \~$500 at current metal prices. That's approaching a trillion dollars in metal in just two of the three contract areas.

The CFO goes into detail here:

More details here:

[https://investors.metals.co/news-events/events-and-presentations](https://investors.metals.co/news-events/events-and-presentations)

Since Trump has been elected, he has appointed a lot of very pro mining, and specifically, pro deep sea mining members to his cabinet. Some information on that here:

[https://mailchi.mp/8eea6f13414e/tmc\_jan25\_update-12701606](https://mailchi.mp/8eea6f13414e/tmc_jan25_update-12701606)

The CEO has claimed to be able to extract all 866 million tons of nodules from their NORI contract area over a 23 year period. 37 million tons per year.

Recent event in India where the CEO speaks:

(They discuss ""dark oxygen"" around 9:23:15)

[https://youtu.be/oPIZAKikd48?t=32660](https://youtu.be/oPIZAKikd48?t=32660)

Current capabilities based on their production vessel (The Hidden Gem) are 1.3m tons per year, with plans to upgrade the vessel to 3m tons per year before extraction starts in early 2026.

Revenues to start will be $650m per year, eventually scaling up to $18.5bn per year after a ""few"" years. I'm holding until $69.42 (\~$23.8bn MC).

""If you don't ROCK AND STONE you ain't comin' home"".

TLDR;

I saw a dude with a rock and decided to yolo my life savings into the stock.

Germany Set for Trillion-Euro Defense and Infrastructure Splurge,512,1jgdnj3,https://www.wsj.com/articles/germany-set-for-trillion-euro-defense-and-infrastructure-splurge-3cce7723,93,2025-03-21 15:56:17,"Germany‚Äôs mammoth spending package cleared its last parliamentary hurdle, paving the way for as much as ‚Ç¨1 trillion in civilian and defense investments to jolt the region‚Äôs economy and reduce its military reliance on the U.S.

But economists and defense experts have warned that for Germany and Europe to reap the full benefits, the wall of money would need to be flanked with ambitious‚Äîand not necessarily popular‚Äîstructural overhauls, including tax, bureaucracy and labor-market reforms.

Germany‚Äôs spending plan, equivalent to around $1.08 trillion, has drawn cheers across a continent unnerved by signs that the U.S. is downgrading its security commitment to Europe and seeking a rapprochement with President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs Russia, which is seen as the region‚Äôs biggest threat.

‚ÄúBerlin is breaking the piggy bank, and it‚Äôs doing it even before the next government is in office,‚Äù said Fran√ßois Heisbourg, a Paris-based expert on strategy and defense who has advised the French president. ‚ÄúGermany is giving itself the means to become a military force to match its economic and strategic weight. That‚Äôs a sea change.‚Äù

Friedrich Merz, winner of last month‚Äôs German election and the man in line to become chancellor, has pledged to focus on European cooperation after the departing government became increasingly distracted by internal frictions between the coalition‚Äôs three parties.

The German spending plan he developed marks a U-turn for Berlin, which for years preached fiscal discipline to its European neighbors while letting its military atrophy for lack of investment. The package‚Äôs scale dwarfs a ‚Ç¨158 billion defense fund floated by the European Commission this month to support military spending in the European Union and fund future help for Ukraine.¬†

The German decision is especially credible, Heisbourg said, because it would directly benefit German arms manufacturers, including Rheinmetall, an armored-vehicle and ammunition manufacturer, and others that have proven their ability to deliver large orders quickly on behalf of Ukraine.¬†

The spending package is made possible by a constitutional amendment that effectively exempts defense-related spending from the provisions of Germany‚Äôs strict fiscal rules, which ban budget deficits bigger than 0.35% of gross domestic product. This exemption will apply not just to spending on military hardware but also on cybersecurity, intelligence and civil protection.¬†

Because Germany has relatively low public debt, the upshot is that it will from now on be able to spend as much on defense as investors are willing to lend it‚Äîat least and as long as overall spending doesn‚Äôt breach the EU‚Äôs more lenient spending rules.¬†

‚ÄúThe priority now is to make sure that the money is being spent efficiently and not only to plug gaps in hardware,‚Äù said Ben Schreer, executive director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies‚Äô Europe office in Berlin. ‚ÄúNow we have the possibility to think about the capacities that we need to build‚Äîin software, in artificial intelligence, in communications, in space‚Äîif we‚Äôre going to become less dependent on the U.S.‚Äù

The amendment also creates a ‚Ç¨500 billion investment fund to be spent on the country‚Äôs long-neglected transport, communication, digital and power infrastructure as well as on measures to combat climate change, over the next 12 years.

The legislation was designed so that only new investment is eligible for funding‚Äîa provision meant to prevent existing investments from migrating from the ordinary budget into the fund.¬†¬†

After the amendment gathered the necessary two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament on Tuesday and Friday, the package‚Äôs implementation will depend on detailed legislation that will be drafted when the next government takes office.

This is likely to happen at the end of April as Merz‚Äôs conservatives and their prospective center-left coalition partners are still locked in negotiations over the government‚Äôs policy agenda for the next four years. While the two buried their differences to push the spending package through, they remain at odds on issues ranging from how much should be done to combat illegal immigration to the merits of cutting income and corporate tax.

The spending package has caused some consternation in conservative ranks after Merz campaigned against relaxing the country‚Äôs fiscal rules. But most economists agree that the combination of rapid rearmament and much-needed infrastructure investments could be a boon for an economy that has barely grown since before the Covid-19 pandemic and has been in recession for the past two years.

The plan could help Germany‚Äôs GDP grow by 0.3% this year and 2.1% by 2027 if it is implemented quickly, according to insurer Allianz. While Germany‚Äôs public debt was set to fall rapidly on the previous spending trajectory, it could now reach 68% of GDP by 2027, Allianz said‚Äîstill low by European and U.S. standards and likely without a sizable impact on the country‚Äôs funding costs.¬†

But the group‚Äôs economists also warned that unlocking and maintaining this level of growth over time without rekindling inflation would require Germany to implement a number of structural overhauls, including fixing its unsustainable pension system, increasing incentives to work and innovate, and cutting taxes, not all of which would be popular with voters.

Likewise, the economic fallout from the extra military spending would be biggest if Germany ensures most of the money is spent at home and in Europe and a substantial share of it goes to research and development, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. This would increase the likelihood that military innovations find their way into the private sector, thus boosting growth further.¬†

‚ÄúThe planned defense spending can give Germany a structural boost if it is spent correctly,‚Äù said Moritz Schularick, the institute‚Äôs president.

Analysts said the next government would also need to fix slow, bureaucratic and inefficient procurement processes at the Defense Ministry to ensure that the extra money borrowed on capital markets can actually be absorbed by the military.¬†

What's TSLA worth in a fire sale?,445,1jf9qq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jf9qq8/whats_tsla_worth_in_a_fire_sale/,485,2025-03-20 03:58:58,"Occasionally, I see people suggest TSLA could go to $0. Obviously, any company can go to $0 if it's mismanaged for long enough, so sure, TSLA could go to $0. But some people have explicitly claimed that TSLA is basically a dead man walking, and could go to $0 any day now. This seems wrong, and it's kind of become a pet peeve for me.  
  
But what's the right answer? What's TSLA worth if tomorrow Elon Musk has a psychotic break tomorrow and is filmed running naked through the National Mall, a la the Kony 2012 guy?

Tesla's [most recent annual financial statement](https://ir.tesla.com/sec-filings) lists a ""stockholder's equity"" also known as book value, of $72.913 billion. Divide by 3.22 billion shares and you get the [reported of book value per share](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/key-statistics/) $22.67. (My calculator says $22.64 but I assume that's a rounding error.)

That $72.913 billion book value comes from $122.070 billion in assets, including $58.360 billion in ""current assets"", less $48.390 billion in liabilities. Now according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_asset):

>In accounting, a current asset is an asset that can reasonably be expected to be sold, consumed, or exhausted through the normal operations of a business within the current fiscal year, operating cycle, or financial year. In simple terms, current assets are assets that are held for a short period.

If you look at the details of the balance sheet, the current assets are mostly stuff that would retain its value pretty well in a disaster, stuff like ""cash"" and ""short-term investments"". Strictly speaking if TSLA is holding a one-year bond its value on March 19th might be more or less than it was worth on December 31st, but assuming the value is unchanged isn't the worst assumption. The big exception, AFAICT, is ""inventory"", of which the balance sheet shows $12.017 billion.

Now, if you assume that when TMZ posts that naked Elon Musk video, all Tesla's inventory and all its non-current assets become worthless, yeah that bankrupts the company. But that's pretty clearly a bad assumption. The inventory might have to be marked down, but to $0? Maybe no hypothetical acquirer wants a Cybertruck factory, but factories can be retooled. Placing a market sell for Tesla's $1.076 billion worth of crypto might not return much cash, but presumably an acquirer wouldn't be that stupid. And I'm not an accountant, but ""deferred tax assets"" (valued at $6.524 billion) sound like something an acquirer might value at close to par?

So maybe we mark down Tesla's inventory by half (\~$6.009 billion); we mark down its crypto, which is overwhelmingly Bitcoin, based on how much Bitcoin has declined since December 31st (\~$0.078 billion), and we mark down other non-current assets (excepting deferred tax assets) by half (\~$28.133 billion), which gives us a fire sale value of about $38.69 billion or about $12/share.

I'm a software engineer, not an accountant or investment banker, so someone with more expertise in fundamentals analysis than I could probably come up with a better estimate than $12/share. But the fact remains you probably shouldn't place any bets that depend on TSLA going to $0 by end of next week.

Even though, yeah, fuck Elon.

Anyway, here's my position, which I'm holding today's movement be damned:

Defense Stocks Are Booming‚ÄîIs There Still Room to Run?,436,1jc2f8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jc2f8g/defense_stocks_are_boomingis_there_still_room_to/,227,2025-03-16 00:32:03,"https://preview.redd.it/h1xog6gshwoe1.png?width=1278&format=png&auto=webp&s=49d93687dd7840e7e030b458e570d305deef1288

So while everyone was busy buying overpriced tech stocks and fighting over Tech crumbs, **European defense stocks**  **have been the real Players ?.** The sector has outperformed the global market **by 5x**, and Rheinmetall is basically a legal money printer (+200% YoY).

# Why?

Because w$r (or the fear of it) is **one hell of a business model.** Europe is suddenly remembering that p‚Ç¨ace doesn't come cheap, and government5 are **throwing cash at defense contractors** like they just discovered NAT0 has an invoice.

# Winners So Far:

üá©üá™ Rheinmetall: **+200%** (Did Germany just become a defense powerhouse again? Historically, that‚Äôs gone *great*.)  
üá≥üá¥ Kongsberg: **+127%** (Norway out here making missiles and oil money‚Äîdiversification king.)  
üáÆüáπ Leonardo: **+112%** (Italy cooking more than just pasta.) !?

# Still Room to Run?

Expected revenue growth says yes:  
üá©üá™ Rheinmetall: **+30% per year** (*We make tanks, we sell tanks, we make more tanks.*)  
üá´üá∑ Dassault Aviation: **+21%** (*Jets go brrr.*)  
üá∏üá™ Saab: **+15%** (*Sweden is supposed to be neutral but also wants to make money‚Äîrespect.*)

# What‚Äôs Next?

* Europe isn't going to *stop* spending on defense anytime soon. If anything, **things are just getting started.**
* The best-performing companies have **strong margins** and **consistent government contracts**‚Äîless risk of a rug pull.
* The real question: **How much longer do these stocks run before they get overbought?**

Sincerly Any Bets?

My black swan has her wings - LMT into the toilet make puts go BOOM!,428,1jd2b7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jd2b7h/my_black_swan_has_her_wings_lmt_into_the_toilet/,311,2025-03-17 07:51:36,"ETA 3/21/25: Ok so I got wildly lucky with the announcement on the NGAD. This wasn't part of my thesis but I'll take the 'bank error in your favor' and I'll even pass Go and collect my $200 on top. I took profits on some of my puts and am going to wait for things to settle out before picking up more. I'll ride the ones I have. I still believe in my thesis and I think that now, with NGAD off the table, any announcements of cancelled F35 orders will have a much bigger impact as LMT is no longer in the running for the replacement which means it needs the long tail of service contracts that Canada and other EU orders would have added onto their order books. I'm still looking for a big drop between now and the post earnings period but at this point I'll be using profits on the play to keep in the game. YMMV

ETA: My thesis applies to LMT for the period from 3/17/25 through end of May 2025. More or less an earnings play but I'm not sure if the drop will be before, on or after earnings.

ETA: some additional context at the bottom of the post that address legitimate questions that I think I can answer from comments

ETA: Updated my position to reflect adding another put option. To me on this day (3/17/2025) the market seems like it wants to keep trading back up to test 5737, maybe as high as 5809, before we see the next leg down. So I will add more as we approach those levels.

\-------------------------------------

I could write a separate post about why I think we are about to experience a black swan event (or really a black swan period) and I'm not sure if this particular point I am going to discuss will cause it. Either way there is a ton of money to be made on LMT in the next few hours / days / weeks or months.

Hard to know exactly when the market will realize just how much POTUS has fucked up LMT's business and then from there I don't know if the market will immediately see the contagion risk for other US defense companies. It may take some time for this to sink in, not sure.

Ok so about LMT - Lockheed Martin is a defense contractor. The big thing to know for this is that they make the most expensive and capable fighter aircraft (war plane for shooting down other planes and/or dropping bombs) in the world. There are huge reliability and quality issues but end of the day nothing for sale by any company on the planet can beat it and nations across the globe (Canada, UK, Germany, many other nations across Europe, etc.) have placed orders ranging from a few billion dollars to hundreds of billions for F35 aircraft and after acquisition support and maintenance. The purchase price is roughly **$125,000,000** each (I'm not sure if that includes maintenance and support, I think maybe just support but there would be additional significant amounts of money going to LMT for maintenance over time).

With hundreds of billions of dollars of orders on the books, many more statements of intent from nations like Portugal, Turkiye, etc. and the associated revenue streams from maintenance, ammunition, etc. LMT has been looking pretty great since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine which sent nations across the globe scrambling to buy the bets military tech they could afford.

But that brings us to today. Where things are suddenly changing drastically and in ways that are likely not reversible, at least not in any reasonable timeframe. The market hasn't yet priced this in and I don't know exactly when that will happen. Could be during the April earnings release. Could be tomorrow when trading begins. Could be anytime between now and then.

See the thing is; when you are a nation that has managed to pull together a couple of billion dollars to buy military aircraft that you intend to use for the next 20, 30 maybe even 40 years, you tend to really think through the decision. There are many factors involved; not the least of which is how reliant are you on the manufacturer (and the nation that manufacturer is based in) for support and maintenance.  Obviously if you can bring support and maintenance to your own nation then the dollars spent at least stay in your own country however that isn't always possible, especially with cutting edge top of the line systems, like the F35. Anyone who owns and operates the F35 platform will need unfettered access to LMT resources and specialists in order to get anywhere close to 100% of the benefit you might expect to get from having these in your air force. Just keeping them flying without access to LMT might prove impossible, let alone using all the fancy bells and whistles which in some cases rely on access to US military satellites in orbit.

The other piece to this puzzle is that these planes take A LONG time to build. Canada ordered 88 planes for about $9,000,000,000 back in 2023 and they are expected to get their first batch of 16 sometime next year. And they have only paid for those first 16 so not much they can do about that. But there are 72 F35 planes at roughly $125,000,000 a pop that they haven't paid for but LMT has in their order books. This is Canada I'm speaking about, the nation that POTUS keeps insisting will become part of the USA (whether they want to or not) and has been using economic extortion to try and extract trade concessions. That already made the idea of buying these additional 72 plans dicey but then you had POTUS suddenly cancel all military maintenance and support contracts between US defense contractors and Ukraine. This was walked back a bit but it made everybody sit up and think about the fact that POTUS was so mercurial that the idea of buying incredibly expensive weapons that could be hobbled on the word of POTUS maybe isn't the best idea.

Since close of market on Friday the following has happened:

1. The nation of Portugal (which had previously said they intended to buy some F35s) has announced they will look for alternatives that are manufactured in Europe. These aren't firm orders but they do represent part of the potential customer based for the F35.
2. Then Turkiye, who has wanted to purchase the F35 for years and was prevented from doing so due to some geopolitical stuff announced that they would buy 40 fighter aircraft from the UK. Now these planes aren't nearly as good (or expensive as the F35) however the idea that Turkiye would invest what will end up being hundreds of millions of dollars into aircraft that aren't F35s and more importantly aren't from their usual military aircraft supplier (the USA) means that any future plans to purchase the F35 is now in doubt.
3. Canada has now announced they intend to look for alternatives to the F35 instead of moving forward with the purchase of an additional 72 planes. I don't know if this will mean they are breaking a contract or maybe it is just rescinding a statement of intent. That is a question I don't have the answer to at the moment but it really doesn't matter. These were sales that are currently reflected in the LMT stock price that are now, for all intents and purposes, cancelled.

So that is my play - I am going to be buying more puts on LMT to add to what I already have over time (current position below)

ETA 3/17/25: Picked up June 20th $400P x1

https://preview.redd.it/8sccerz7s5pe1.png?width=1229&format=png&auto=webp&s=550517e5f82379d8e6f412d617ccb9a12bd68505

ETA: 3/21/25 sold the June $400P and all 5 of the $370P plus 5 of the $330P. The 5 remaining June $330P I'll leave as free runners. I figure we hit a local low. If the stock trades sideways I'll save theta and if it bounces I'll have a buying opportunity for more puts. If it crashes I have those 5 runners. Cheers to all who are following this tiny drama of mine

I was already expecting a complete market crash as a result of POTUS' choices and actions. I've made some nice money in the last three weeks as a result. However I think we are just getting started and SOMETHING is going to lead to a bear market, possibly a depression. This thing with LMT could be the black swan that does it because when the market realizes the above is the reality of the situation there is a logical next thought: what about OTHER platforms and systems, whether made by LMT or other US defense contractors.

Buying Patriot air defense systems or already own some and think you might need to buy some ammunition? Maybe time to look around at diversifying your supplier for anti aircraft and anti missile systems in case POTUS decides he doesn't like you.

What about new tanks and armored transports? Probably not the kind of thing that relies as heavily on the manufacturer but spare parts and software updates will still be needed and if you have to switch to another supplier for additional vehicles down the road you will now have multiple platforms in operation which complicates logistics, training and operations, tactical operations, etc. That can impact decision making on new purchases.

Naval vessels? Advanced radar systems to use on the weapons platform (that flies, drives or sails) which you are purchasing from a different manufacturer? These are the most complex technical systems on the planet and often have components from different manufacturers. LMT might make the plane but it uses things made by RTX and other defense companies.

And this isn't something that you can easily fix. POTUS can promise to be nice and stay on his best behavior.... which I don't think he would even be willing to say let alone follow through on. But even if he did say it are militaries around the world going to want to have to rely on that? Can they risk having their nation's ability to defend itself hinge on the good will of someone who could favorably be described as inconsistent?

I don't know if the collapse of the US defense sector will lead to a complete market crash. But I think it has a chance. Either way I'm confident something will do that and in the mean time LMT puts seem rife with opportunity at the moment.

ETA:

The USA is the biggest customer for the US arms industry, \~70% of LMT's customers are right here in the USA:

In terms of my specific DD for this specific arms manufacturer at this specific moment in time - LMT is currently filling orders on what is the most expensive defense production run in human history. It is valued at over a trillion dollars for the life of the platform (from development, through production and to the end of post production support such as spare parts, software updates and maintenance). The vast majority of that mammoth expense was shouldered by the USA and funded design, development and early production. The plan originally was for many additional nations to place orders to meet per unit cost targets. But the system was just too expensive and there was actually a bit of a crisis from the early 2000's up until 2022 because the USA was basically the \*only\* customer which meant the entire cost of the project was on the USA. Then Russia invaded Ukraine and started doing war crimes in full view of satellites. Canada who had been on the fence for years suddenly ordered 88. The UK massively upped their order. A bunch of other nations in Europe and beyond placed or expanded orders and the cost per unit has plunged. All to say that the last 10 years have been all USA and the next 10 years were supposed to be mostly Europe, Middle East, South Asia, South East Asia, Australia/NZ, etc.

Also in general I am very bearish on many industries in the USA including defense\*

They are supporting NASA‚Äôs Artemis program (for exploration, research, building infrastructures and digital lunar communications), and are notably partnered with Nokia to deploy the first cellular network on the Moon during the upcoming IM-2 mission.

Let's now see what happened to their stock price during their first mission.

* February 15, 2024: Intuitive Machines' first Moon mission, IM-1 (Nova-C lunar lander). Over the course of four days since launch date LUNR stock rose \~150%.

Second Lunar Mission is scheduled to launch as soon as Feb 26th, and we may experience a new cycle of strong valorization, starting next week. Especially as we are now facing a one month correction since 24th January that brought the stock from peaks of $25 into current lows of $18, where we see strong support on the EMA 200 in the daily chart.

TL;DR: Expect a strong rise in LUNR stock price next week in anticipation to the Second Lunar Mission launch scheduled to Feb 26th (they may move dates if any unexpected meteorological event happens).

**Effects:** Deepened the Great Depression by triggering international retaliation. U.S. trade collapsed by over 60%. Consumers faced higher prices while farmers lost export markets. Contributed to bank failures and prolonged economic suffering until reversed by the 1934 Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act.

*2. Import Substitution Industrialization (Latin America, 1950s-1970s)*
**Effects:** Initially created manufacturing jobs and reduced import dependency. However, led to inefficient industries, technological stagnation, and limited consumer choices. Consumers paid higher prices for lower-quality goods. Eventually contributed to the Latin American debt crisis as protected industries couldn't compete globally.

*3. Japanese Auto Quotas (USA, 1980s)*
**Effects:** Protected U.S. automakers but increased car prices by an estimated $1,000 per vehicle for American consumers. Created windfall profits for Japanese manufacturers who shifted to higher-end vehicles. American automakers delayed necessary modernization. Cost American consumers approximately $5 billion annually.

*4. South Korean Development Tariffs (1960s-1980s)*
**Effects:** Initially supported industrial development when combined with export promotion policies. Temporary protection allowed industries like steel and electronics to develop. However, consumers paid higher prices, and eventual liberalization proved difficult politically. Successful mainly because protection was strategic, temporary, and tied to export performance requirements.

*5. U.S.-China Trade War (2018-2020)*
**Effects:** Caused American consumers to pay approximately $51 billion in additional costs annually. Protected some manufacturing jobs but created job losses in agriculture and manufacturing sectors using imported inputs. Reduced farm exports due to Chinese retaliation. U.S. companies absorbed about 75% of the costs rather than Chinese exporters. GDP growth slowed by an estimated 0.3% while inflation increased.

Each case demonstrates how tariffs create concentrated benefits for specific industries while typically imposing broader costs across the economy through higher prices and reduced economic efficiency.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

EU may delay first counter-tariffs against U.S. to mid-April,353,1jfmfnk,https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/eu-may-delay-first-set-counter-tariffs-against-us-mid-april-2025-03-20/,135,2025-03-20 16:41:47,"BRUSSELS, March 20 (Reuters) - The European Union could delay imposition of a first set of counter-measures against the United States over President Donald Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs until mid-April, European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said on Thursday.

The European Commission had proposed re-imposing tariffs on 4.5 billion euros ($4.9 billion) of U.S. products on April 1, followed by hitting a further 18 billion euros of U.S. goods on April 13.

""We are now considering to align the timing of the two sets of EU counter-measures so we can consult with member states on both lists simultaneously, and this would also give us extra time for negotiations with our American partners,"" Sefcovic told a hearing at the European Parliament.

The first set of EU counter-measures includes applying a 50% tariff on U.S. bourbon. Trump threatened to slap a 200% tariff on all wines and other alcoholic products coming from the EU if the bloc went ahead with this.

The Trump administration is also planning further tariffs on April 2.

French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou said on Sunday that the EU was probably mistaken in targeting American whiskey, while Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni cautioned EU partners on Tuesday against escalating the trade dispute with the United States.

""I am not certain that responding to tariffs with more tariffs is necessarily a good deal,"" Meloni, who is close to Trump, said."

In Trump's address to Congress last night, he did not sugarcoat what his plans will do - saying to farmers that there will be pain, although coming out the other side stronger. The tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico are going to drive an insane amount of inflation. GDP Now is showing a massive contraction this quarter, (importantly, not just from import frontloading, but from massive investment slowdowns), and jobs reports are down. Yet, the market keeps chugging along, irrational as ever about the status quo collapsing around them. Fuck, even this morning, SPY ripped 1.5% on just auto being exempt from the tariffs.
Quite, simply, we're pretending everything's fine, and everything's not fine. All its gonna take for the market to rip downward is a bit more inflation, and layoffs, and retail is going to start dipping heavy into their invested money to stay afloat. Combine that with the market plugging its ears and screaming at the massive political instability, when something does finally break through to them - whatever it ends up being, a super negative job report, the next terrible inflation report - the market will rip through the floor in panic. It doesn't have to stay there - for vix calls to be worth it, you don't have to be right everytime, you only have to be right once.

Just a reminder on GDP about to rip through the floor:

**Why the Surge?**

EU nations boosting defense spending due to security concerns.

Increased military aid to Ukraine leading to record-high order books

New EU defense initiatives mobilizing **‚Ç¨800B+ in funding**.

**Warning Signs of a Bubble?**

**Extreme Valuations**: Rheinmetall‚Äôs **P/E ratio of \~70**, far exceeding industry norms (15-30).

**Hype vs. Reality**: Market caps rising faster than actual production capacity growth.

**Defense Budgets = Political Risk**: Future governments may scale back spending once tensions ease.

Played puts early in the week and made a few K but sold. Was going to buy back in but hesitated and missed out. Finally bought back in and these were up, but decided I‚Äôd hold this time instead of sell like I did with my OG puts. Those OG puts hit 100% at the bottom Friday. So this time I decided to hold and we will see how that goes. Worst case scenario imo it could take till beginning of April to tank, but I figured I‚Äôd hop in now so I don‚Äôt miss out if it crawls down little by little till then.

Nobody knows obviously, but I feel pretty confident we‚Äôre heading down hard. In my opinion I know ‚Äúthis is different‚Äù is kind of getting memed, but I genuinely believe that to be the case. There has been an underlying system since WWII with America at the helm in many ways. There has been decades of role propositioning and reinforcement through reconstruction after the war. So many people talk about an ‚Äúovervalued‚Äù market, when it really wasn‚Äôt in a relative sense of what American markets represented with reliability, certainty, and trust. I think SOME damage has already been done, and nothing is gonna change that for a long time. In my opinion it really just comes down to how much damage will ultimately be done. With that said, with this administration, and my own run away thoughts, I really can‚Äôt pin how far a drop I see as realistic, but obviously with my play I‚Äôm expecting around -3% from here absolute minimum.

MRNA DD,261,1ivvm3t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ivvm3t,155,2025-02-23 04:31:38,"TLDR:  MRNA calls


What‚Äôs up guys?  I‚Äôm following up my WMT earnings play with another dip into MRNA.  I follow this stock closely and have posted about it before.  Those that tailed last time made money(although it was a painful hold).  I like MRNA because it is prone to pretty large moves, and options can gain(and lose) value very quickly. Here is why I bought calls on Friday.


1.  The big news Friday that led to a 5% jump in MRNA.   Scientists in China found a covid-like virus in bats studied in a lab.  This is significant because this virus enters the human body through a similar pathway as Covid-19.   The vast majority of coronaviruses cannot infect humans, but SARS Covid-19 and this new virus both use the same receptor to enter human cells and replicate.  This news was fairly fresh on Friday, with only a couple outlets reporting it.  I think that after a weekend of this info spreading, we will see strong buying pressure on MRNA early next week.  


2.  Avian flu is concerns are rising.  The virus is now endemic in cows and cats, showing that it is spreading within mammals.  While this has been happening for a little while and is not really new news, what‚Äôs is new is that the current administration is cutting funding for infectious disease study, and likely keeping important information from being published.  The bare minimum is available on the CDC website, a massive difference between now and 2020 when data was published daily.   This is going to get worse, and it is only a matter of time before we see human to human spreading.  When that happens MRNA will double in price, which is why longer dated calls are a good play IMO.  


3.  Big players are buying here.  Bridgewater Associates(founded by Ray Dalio), the largest hedge fund in the world by AUM, just bought 600,000+ shares, Theleme Partners now owns $300 million worth, and Jane Street just upped their holdings to $150 million.  Book value for MRNA is right around $30.  We saw them miss on EPS but beat on revs recently.  That morning, the stock very briefly dropped to $28, but was bought back up to $33 almost instantly.  In my opinion, $30 is the floor.   It may come down and test it again, but I doubt it given the news Friday.   IF MRNA breaks $30 and closes below $30 on significant volume, I will likely abandon this thesis and consider it a lost cause. 


4.  The technicals are very bullish.  There is a significant bullish RSI divergence on both the daily and the weekly(yes I drew a line on the RSI).  MACD is turning up on both time frames as well.  This is the exact same RSI setup that helped me see the WMT pivot last week.  I know it‚Äôll get ragged on here, but it helps me spot reversals so I add it to the list of clues.  


5.  The options chain.  The put/call volume ratio for next week is 0.10.  For those that don‚Äôt know, that means 10 times as many call options were traded as put options.  The open interest put/call ratio is 0.65, still very bullish.   The one caveat to the volume is one trader may have entered a large call credit spread, which would be bearish, but it could also be a hedge.  HOWEVER, there will still be about 78,000 open call contracts between $35 and $41 that could act as a magnet.  There are also around 58,000 call options in open interest at the $45 and $50 strikes for March 21.  Those are a bit safer and I will likely roll some of my already purchased weeklies into those. 


6.  Volume.  It‚Äôs been elevated since November.  In the early Covid days, MRNA would regularly get 20-40 million share days.  Towards the end of 2021 until Nov 2024, the average day would be between 2-6 million shares or so.  In the last week, volume has not dipped below 10 million, and hit 21 million shares on Friday.  


I think MRNA is gearing up for a move to the upside.  I have $40 and $41 calls expiring this week, but I will roll them to a later date if I think it‚Äôs appropriate. Quick note, MRNA tends to run really hard in one direction in the first 10 minutes of trading.  That direction is usually a fake out, and it often reverse very quickly.  Again, it‚Äôs prone to very large, very fast moves.   Know your risk tolerance.  If you catch 100% gains at open and want to bail, do it.  If you‚Äôre down 50%, don‚Äôt panic.  


Two earnings plays that I‚Äôm looking at are HD puts(similar theory to my WMT DD) or possibly LOW puts to play for sympathy without the IV crush,  and CLF calls.  


None of this is financial advice.

Bought most of the GOOGL when it was at 185, 182 and 180, and AMZN at 222, 215 and 212 around last week. I did expect the market to pull back but did not expect a big on on GOOGL and then AMZN. 

I still believe GOOGL and AMZN will make a run back up after weathering this selloff, and I do have some times on my side. But multiple selloff days definitely trickering a little doubts in the play right now. 

My plan is to hold until at least breakeven for most of GOOGL call and start revising based on the economy at the time. But I still believe Nancy holding big portions of GOOGL and AMZN for certain reasons. "
Why you should buy debt collector stocks,246,1j85djl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j85djl,125,2025-03-10 23:48:15,"Macro environment
1. When you ignore your margin call for 6 months and the debt is sold to a collection agency you can legally make them forgive your debt, since you technically own their company. 
2. Total consumer debt is at ita highest level ever, and deliquencies greater than 90 days are their highest since 2008, with the important exception of mortgages. 
3. Household debt service payments as a percent of GDP and a percent of household disposable income are at low levels. I think this suggests that the consumer is mostly healthy, and most deliquent debts should be recoverable. 

Individual stock pick
I favor PRAA. They recently had a rough patch post pandemic, which resulted in a leadership change and turnaround plan. By all metrics both seem to have been effective, but as of today they are trading near their lowest levels from the past few years. 
1. Praa's p/e ratio is low( 11), when most of their history they traded around 15-20. P/s and p/b ratios are their lowest ever. 
2. As PRAA continues to implement their turn around plan, sales and margins should both increase. Forward pe is around 8.5. 
3. The rest of the market is at a frothy valuation, making this a rare value pick. 
4. The recent dip seems to be a combo of poor consumer sentiment and a bad ER from one of their competitors, plus general market correction. 
5. Praa purchased the most debt it ever has in 2024, which means it should return highest sales/earnings ever in the future. They also have the highest level of estimated remaining collections ever. 
6. None of PRAAs debt comes due for another 2 years. 
7. Return on average tangible equity is forecasted to be 12% this year, a 30% increase over 2024. In 2022, PRAA had a 15% ROATE, and their stock price peaked at $50. 

I think PRAA can hit $30 in the next 12 months. 

Positions are in the images. Also have about 7000 invested into PRAA in my 401k, soon to be $10k.

What to look for in FED meeting tomorrow 3/19,243,1jeig6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jeig6j/what_to_look_for_in_fed_meeting_tomorrow_319/,70,2025-03-19 04:24:27,"**Jerome Powell's Speech:**¬†Don't be too concerned with Jerome Powell's speech tomorrow, because it will most likely be a copy of his speech from a week ago at the press conference. The market rallied over 1% on that speech as Jerome Powell tried to calm the markets. Mostly consisted of ""wait and see"" and ""the data is still fine"". The truth is we had a decent CPI and Jobs read for Feb, and PMI and consumer Sentiment were mediocre. The Fed simply cannot make a drastic stance on cuts or the economy this early without sufficient data.

**Dot Plot:**¬†The most important thing to look for in the FOMC meeting tomorrow is the brand new revised dot plot. Every major investment bank along with CME Fed watch has their current predictions on rate cuts for 2025 at 2-3 cuts (leaning more towards 3). If we see the 19 members of the fed come out tomorrow and say they disagree with that, and we are more likely to stay with 2 cuts for 2025, we could see a sharp repricing down, as rate cuts are very bullish for the equities market. (you are going to want to see more dots shift down to the line right above 3.5)

[Dec 2024 Dot Plot](https://preview.redd.it/5nidotlj2jpe1.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=4262ada3bd7032b9e81342eebc1ab8f30fdd4151)

**Summary of Economic Projections:**¬†Lastly is if the Fed will project a lower GDP then in there last prediction in December. They currently have it at 2.1% for 2025, which was raised from Sept 2024's prediction of 2.0%. But also note they increased their inflation metrics heavily in December.

https://preview.redd.it/yjiz1afp2jpe1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c35aa479d40f066919285c8272ab43606015ff

Dec 2024 Projections

The last summary of projections was a sharp change to inflation reigniting due to their cuts, but also that GDP and Unemployment would improve slightly as a result. With new fiscal policies causing fears that we wont get those improvement in GDP or Unemployment, it really puts the Fed in a tough place where these new projections for March almost seem certain to be downgrades.

[GDP 2025 Projections](https://preview.redd.it/yc5hpmu42jpe1.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6d1932796db56357111549000d6f577c926191b)

The other thing to note is that the 2025 GDP projections have the widest distribution of all their 2025 projections. Meaning that the fed members are the most split or undecided on this decision, and that the new data could potentially really swing those numbers down. Opposed to unemployment where 14 of 19 Fed members all picked 4.3% for 2025, and are less likely to all be swayed or moved.

[Unemployment 2025 Projections](https://preview.redd.it/i3xbsfs82jpe1.png?width=578&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0277eed836fe102e11c728f263d4ce3e0c1d205)

**Summary:**¬†I personally believe we will get sharp adjustments down to GDP and slightly up to unemployment, while inflation will stay close to the same (maybe lowered a little). If this isn't met with the Dot Plot increasing the Fed's stance from 2 to 3 cuts for 2025 (I have no prediction for this as there are so many factors), expect more short term pain in the markets as investment banks downgrade and reprice assets down."

OPEC+ to Begin Long-Delayed Supply Hike Amid Trump Pressure,222,1j2q8gv,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-03/opec-to-begin-long-delayed-supply-restart-amid-trump-pressure,59,2025-03-04 00:24:15,"> OPEC+ will proceed with plans to revive halted oil production after repeated delays, amid pressure from President Donald Trump to lower oil prices. Crude extended losses.

> In a surprise move, the group led by Saudi Arabia and Russia will go ahead with the increase of 138,000 barrels a day in April, delegates said. It will be the first in a series of monthly hikes to revive production halted for more than two years, which will gradually restore a total of 2.2 million barrels a day by 2026, delegates said. 

> Crude traders had widely expected that OPEC+ would once again delay the restart, which it had postponed three times since first announcing a supply roadmap last June. 

> Oil prices are too low for the Saudis and many other members to government spending, and global markets are on track for a supply surplus later this year."

Why is $GRND is flying under the radar?,217,1ixdqpv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ixdqpv/why_is_grnd_is_flying_under_the_radar/,134,2025-02-25 03:06:33,"I know you're all intimately familiar with $GRND, so why is nobody discussing it? It seems a lot more interesting than $HOOD or $RDDT.

They have a monopoly on gay sex, plus whenever I open the app I get like 50 messages so I know it's gotta be the most active dating app on a per user basis.


I'm not an expert but they had some outstanding warrants that were only redeemable up to like $18, and lo and behold the day they expire the stock finally breaks $19? Interesting.


positions: $GRND 3/21 $20 and $18 calls


Edit: counterpoints:


**""The app sucks to use.""** Valid. That's by design to milk lonely dudes for membership fees. I think Grindr is more robust here than other dating apps because 1. The average guy's chance of getting a response or even some action is way higher than other apps, making the premium membership a better value proposition for the target demographic and 2. The ""high interest"" users that paid users are targeting are not going to be deterred by the current monetization strategy. Of course guys who are trying to honestly use the app are gonna have a bad time. The revenue doesn't come from them and never has. 


**""It's been going up for a while.""** So has every stonk that's worth a shit. They have a roughly $3.5b valuation, making them about 1/3 Match's size. I don't think the two are super comparable for a number of reasons, but I do think their userbase is significantly more resilient. I don't see a world where Grindr is worth less than half of Match for long.


**""You are gay.""** Correct

But it wasn‚Äôt all smooth sailing; there were plenty of heart-stopping dips along the way, with drawdowns ranging from -10% to -23%. 

Fast forward to 2025, and the Nasdaq looks like it‚Äôs trying to relive its glory days. We‚Äôre currently in correction territory (down over 10% from its peak), which feels eerily familiar to those ‚Äò90s vibes. Stocks like Nvidia are taking the plunge‚Äîdown nearly 30%‚Äîwhile the broader index is doing its best impression of a nervous cat on a slippery floor. The parallels are clear: tech innovation is booming, but volatility is lurking around every corner

The takeaway? Whether it‚Äôs dot-com mania or AI fever, the Nasdaq loves to keep us guessing. It‚Äôs basically that friend who insists on taking you bungee jumping every weekend‚Äîthrilling, terrifying, and somehow addictive. Hang tight, this ride ain‚Äôt over yet! üöÄüìâ

FedEx shares slide as annual forecast cuts stoke worries on economy,202,1jgk4fj,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fedex-shares-drop-annual-forecast-093652731.html,36,2025-03-21 21:25:21,"(Reuters) -FedEx's shares fell 11% on Friday after the parcel delivery firm cut its annual forecasts, fanning worries about the health of U.S. manufacturing amid uncertainty from the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs on trading partners.

CEO Raj Subramaniam warned a day earlier that the company was navigating a very ""challenging operating environment"" and ""weakness in the industrial economy"" was weighing on its higher-margin business-to-business volumes.

The company's shares hit their lowest in nearly two years on Friday. FedEx and rival UPS are viewed as barometers for the global economy due to their involvement across a swathe of industries.

Shipments from companies that produce goods used in manufacturing drive substantial cargo volumes and high-margin deliveries for the delivery firms.

UPS' shares were down 3%, while European peer DHL fell 2.2%.

U.S. President Donald Trump's on-and-off import tariffs have created uncertainty for businesses, prompting them to be more cautious with their spending in an uncertain economic landscape.

Analysts have said Trump's levies could trigger a recession and a trade war, further hammering demand for transportation and delivery services.

""FedEx's Q3 print and full-year forecast cut will likely exacerbate concerns of structural pressures in the parcel business,"" Morgan Stanley said, adding that it may even overwhelm the company's cost-cutting program.

FedEx has been reducing costs as demand for lower-margin e-commerce deliveries from companies such as Temu and Shein outpaces higher-margin business-to-business shipments.

""Management noted weakness in the industrial economy and, while macro is a factor, we believe structural forces are a far bigger headwind than the market thinks,"" Morgan Stanley added.

The company lowered its fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings per share forecast to between $18.00 and $18.60, from $19 to $20 previously.

The forecast cut itself was far from a surprise, but the magnitude, particularly for one remaining quarter, was greater than feared, Evercore ISI said.

At least 10 brokerages cut their price targets on the company's stock on Friday."

Hey everyone, I'm sharing this DD because, compared to other analyses I've seen, there are some key differences and divergences. This is based on my own research, and I wanted to provide a more complete perspective on Gorilla Technology (GRRR) based on what I found . I‚Äôm just a regular small investor (not a financial advisor), currently holding 1,200 shares along with call options ahead of their webinar. I‚Äôve spent a significant amount of time digging into their background, SEC filings, and the controversy surrounding short-seller allegations. If I‚Äôve missed anything or if someone has a different take, I‚Äôd be happy to discuss it.

Many of you in the comments are suggesting that this was AI-generated. While I can say that I spent a lot of time writing and revising it (especially since English isn‚Äôt my first language), you‚Äôll never have proof of that.

And yes, I used my LLM to format the text‚Äî < typical indent used, because who wants to read a long, poorly structured post? I mean, even I wouldn‚Äôt want to read my own post again like that.

Their platforms power video surveillance, facial recognition, network security, and IoT deployments. They work across Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Latin America.

Recent MoUs (memorandums of understanding) indicate massive growth potential, including a $1.8B Thai electric-grid modernization project and a large smart government contract in Egypt. While MoUs aren‚Äôt finalized deals, they show strong business momentum.

On March 3, **The Bear Cave**‚Äîa research firm that digs up short ideas‚Äîreleased a note raising what they called ‚Äúcautionary flags‚Äù about Gorilla Technology. They highlighted Gorilla‚Äôs roughly **1,200%** stock price jump over six months, pointing to the hype around a series of deals and MoUs (Memorandums of Understanding) that might not be fully locked in. The Bear Cave basically argued that investor excitement might be getting ahead of real fundamentals, noting things like Gorilla‚Äôs Cayman Islands registration, workforce distribution (a lot in Taiwan), and its pivot into AI under CEO and Chairman **Jay Chandan**.

Naturally, short-selling activity popped up around the same time. But high short interest doesn‚Äôt automatically mean the short thesis is correct; it just means some folks think the price is inflated or that there are undisclosed issues. Could be right, could be off.

In a press release titled ‚Äú**Gorilla Sets Record Straight on Baseless Market Speculation**,‚Äù on march 6, the company addressed what it calls ‚Äúmisleading and uninformed‚Äù rumors. Some key points:

1. **Analyst Coverage**
   * Gorilla noted it has ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù ratings from **Alliance Global Partners** and **Northland Capital**, which they say contrasts with a short-seller‚Äôs blog post they believe lacks fact-checking.
2. **Financial Transparency**
   * Gorilla says a large chunk of its 2024 Accounts Receivable was collected and reviewed by **Marcum Asia**, part of Marcum LLP, a well-regarded U.S. accounting firm.
   * Gorilla also plans to be **Sarbanes-Oxley compliant by 2024**, which is way earlier than Emerging Growth Companies typically have to be.
3. **Business Evolution & Backlog**
   * Gorilla reiterated it‚Äôs now focused heavily on AI-driven ‚Äúsmart city‚Äù solutions, has a backlog of around **$93 million** for 2025, and guidance of **$90‚Äì100 million** in revenue for this year.
   * The pipeline apparently jumped from **$2 billion to $6 billion**, referencing a **$1.8 billion MoU** for modernizing Thailand‚Äôs electricity grid.
4. **Upcoming Financials**
   * They‚Äôll drop their 2024 full-year numbers on March 31, 2025, and file their 20-F on April 15, 2025. If you‚Äôre following this stock, those dates should matter big-time.

One major highlight is a $1.8 billion, 15-year MoU to overhaul Thailand‚Äôs electricity grid :

* **Potential**: If it transitions to a real, binding contract, that‚Äôs obviously a huge revenue boost.
* **Caution:** An MoU isn‚Äôt a guaranteed contract. There‚Äôs room for either party to back away or revise details.

They‚Äôre also part of **ONE AMAZON**, aiming to protect the Amazon Rainforest with biodegradable sensors, AI analytics, and a blockchain-based market (carbon credits, etc.). Gorilla would handle the technical backbone. Big names like Goldman Sachs, AECOM, and Abu Dhabi Investment Group are involved.

# Recent SEC Filings & Corporate Updates

A few key 6-Ks to note:

1. **September 2024 6-K** (Unaudited H1 2024 Financials)Positives: Substantial top-line growth, a move into profitability, and stronger equity. The actuaol concerns is that MoUs aren‚Äôt locked revenue, currency exposure in Egypt, and the capital structure can be confusing with those preference shares/warrants.
   * **Revenue** for first half of 2024: $20.7M vs. $6.4M the prior year.
   * **Net Income**: $1.61M, flipping from a $7.27M loss.
   * **Total Assets:** $133.1M (up from $115.4M at year-end 2023).
   * **Total Liabilities**: $61.1M (roughly in line with $61.3M prior).
   * **Equity**: $72.1M, compared to $54.2M.
   * A big chunk of future revenues (over $200M) is in Egyptian pounds (EGP), meaning **currency risk** if EGP/USD moves around.
   * Gorilla uses convertible preference shares and private warrants to raise capital‚Äîcreating derivative liabilities (i.e., it can get complicated on the balance sheet).
   * **Cash**: $11.2M vs. $5.3M at year-end.
2. **February 2025 6-K**
   * Gorilla ended its Controlled Equity Offering with Cantor Fitzgerald, so it‚Äôs not pursuing that specific route for raising funds (reduces immediate dilution risk but also any quick capital infusion from that deal).
3. **January 2025 6-K**
   * Updated shares outstanding to \~18.46M after warrant exercises and preference share conversions.

**Takeaway**: Solid revenue growth in H1 2024, profitability, and a bigger equity base. But they really need to convert these big MoUs into final contracts and handle that currency risk (especially in Egypt).

# Short interest and Short Squeeze Potential

I know a lot of you are curious about short squeeze potential, given how volatile GRRR has been. As of the latest data (early March 2025), short interest sits around **1.46 million shares, which is \~8.3% of the float**

That‚Äôs moderately high ‚Äì not in the extreme top tier of squeezed stocks, but notable. One red flag for shorts is that short share availability recently **hit zero** (as of March 7, 2025 there were no shares left to borrow at some brokers), and borrow fees have climbed (around 30+%). This indicates a lot of people have already shorted and there isn‚Äôt much ammo left for new shorts unless some shares free up.

However ‚Äì and this is key ‚Äì the **Short Interest Ratio (Days to Cover) is only \~0.17 days**, which is very low. That means given the high trading volume lately, all shorts combined could theoretically cover their positions in a few hours of trading. A low days-to-cover makes a classic squeeze less likely unless something changes (like volume drying up or a sudden catalyst landing). We also see about 34% of total short volume is happening off-exchange (dark pools)‚Äã, which some interpret as stealthy shorting. It‚Äôs fuel for volatility, no doubt.

Bottom line on a squeeze: The short interest is high enough to contribute to wild swings (and the float is small, \~11M public float), but **shorts aren‚Äôt ‚Äútrapped‚Äù** in the way they are because they can exit relatively quickly. For a true squeeze to happen, we‚Äôd likely need a big catalyst or a drastic reduction in volume that strands shorts. It‚Äôs a factor to watch, but I‚Äôm not banking on a squeeze ‚Äì I‚Äôm more interested in the business story here.

# Technical Analysis

* **Price**: $28.41 (lower in the premarket)
* **RSI** (14): 53.0 (kind of neutral, slightly bullish).
* **MACD**: 4.17 vs. Signal 3.84 (positive crossover).
* **ADX**: 91.3 (signals an extremely strong trend, but that can also mean huge volatility).
* **20-Day Momentum**: +57.2% (big upward trend).
* **5-Day Momentum**: ‚Äì6.2% (short pullback).
* **Annualized Volatility**: \~203% (seriously high).

Interpretation: Trend is bullish in the mid-term, but the stock is extremely volatile

# Overall Assessment & My Two Cents

1. **Business & Growth**
   * Seeing revenue nearly triple from the same period last year is impressive, and flipping to a net profit shows there‚Äôs some real traction.
   * So far, though, a lot depends on huge MoUs (Thailand, Amazon IoF‚Ñ¢, Government of Egypt, etc.) becoming fully binding deals
2. **Bear Cave Critique vs. Bullish Analyst**
   * The Bear Cave points out that hype may be bigger than tangible results.
   * Gorilla cites big-name analysts with ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù calls and a backlog plus pipeline that‚Äôs on the rise. So what? official 2024 numbers in March 2025 and the 20-F on April 15, 2025.
3. **SEC Filings & Governance**
   * Ending the Cantor deal might be good if they don‚Äôt need the capital (less dilution).
   * Currency risk in Egypt is real, but if they manage it, that contract could be huge.
   * The preference shares and warrants can add lumps to the balance sheet (fair-value changes, possible dilution). Something to watch.
4. **Potential Risks**
   * MoU or hype not translating into revenue: If these big deals don‚Äôt convert, the stock could deflate.
   * Currency fluctuations: Especially with large EGP obligations.
   * Volatility: Moves can be abrupt in both directions.
5. **Catalysts**
   * Converting the Thailand MoU into a real contract.
   * The upcoming financial reports (**March 31, 2025, and April 15, 2025**) to see if momentum is real.

Below there is the actual chart :

* **Price vs. SMA20 & SMA50** The stock is trading above its 20-day and 50-day moving averages, which generally signals an ongoing bullish trend.
* **Bollinger Bands** The price has been touching or hovering near the upper band, hinting that it might be in a higher volatility phase (but not necessarily overbought).
* **Volume** We‚Äôre seeing rising volume lately‚Äîoften a sign of increased interest (and possibly momentum) in the stock.
* **MACD** The MACD line is above the signal line, which usually points to bullish momentum, though the histogram has pulled back a bit.
* **RSI (14)** It‚Äôs hanging around mid-range, meaning the stock isn‚Äôt clearly overbought or oversold right now.
* **Stochastic Oscillator** This flips around between overbought and oversold zones, so it can confirm short-term swings. Recently it‚Äôs been more neutral than extreme.
* **Williams %R** Similar story to the Stochastic‚Äîit‚Äôs not maxed out, so not screaming overbought or oversold.
* **ADX (91.3)** A high ADX indicates a strong trend. Since +DI is above ‚ÄìDI, it tilts bullish.
* O**BV** On-Balance Volume is trending up, suggesting buyers are still outweighing sellers overall.

In summay, the chart shows a strong uptrend (with some short-term consolidation signals).

# Addressing some Common Concerns

I want to tackle a few specific points I‚Äôve seen people raise on Reddit ‚Äì and correct (or try to) any misinformation out there:

* ‚Äú**GRRR only had \~$20M in revenue but a $524M market cap** ‚Äì hard pass.‚Äù  ‚Äì I‚Äôve seen this comment, and it‚Äôs quite misleading without context. The \~$20M figure likely refers to Gorilla‚Äôs revenue at some earlier point (possibly the first half of 2024). In reality, Gorilla‚Äôs full-year 2023 revenue was about $64‚Äì65 million (nearly 3√ó higher than 2022‚Äôs revenue)‚Äã. They guided $72M for 2024 and \~$90‚Äì100M for 2025. So, using $20M to judge the company‚Äôs size is way off ‚Äì trailing twelve-month revenue is far higher, and forward revenue is expected to be higher still. At a \~$500M market cap, the stock is trading at roughly 5‚Äì6√ó 2025 sales or around \~21√ó forward EBITDA (using that $20‚Äì25M EBITDA guidance). For a company growing revenues triple-digits and projecting \~30‚Äì40% growth next year, a 5x sales multiple isn‚Äôt outrageous.
* ‚Äú**$20‚Äì25M EBITDA in 2025 isn‚Äôt that great for a $500M company**.‚Äù  ‚Äì This is related to the above. Gorilla‚Äôs 2025 EBITDA guidance of \~$20‚Äì25M is publicly known. If you strictly value it on that, it‚Äôs in the \~25√ó EV/EBITDA range, which isn‚Äôt cheap. But consider two things:
   * (1) This EBITDA is if they only hit $90‚Äì100M revenue. Their backlog and pipeline suggest they could exceed that if things go well (the guidance even explicitly says it doesn‚Äôt include any upside from new large contracts in advanced discussion).
   * (2) High-growth tech companies often trade at rich multiples ‚Äì investors are paying for the growth trajectory. If Gorilla executes and grows into, say, $150M+ revenue by 2026 (just a hypothetical), that EBITDA will scale up quickly with their high margins. So, while I wouldn‚Äôt say GRRR is a deep-value play on near-term EBITDA, the valuation is arguably reasonable for a high-growth AI/IoT stock. It‚Äôs all about whether you believe in their growth story. And remember, the company is already profitable at the net income level (rare for a recent SPAC in the tech space). That profitability and cash generation can support further expansion without constant dilution, which gives some credence to the current valuation.
* ‚Äú**Gorilla operates in developing countries ‚Äì slow payments and regional risk could choke growth.**‚Äù  ‚Äì This is a fair concern. Gorilla‚Äôs big contracts in regions like Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa do carry execution risk. Government clients in developing markets can be slow to pay, and currency fluctuations can impact the value of contracts. For example, Gorilla disclosed that a significant chunk of its future revenue (over $200M) is denominated in Egyptian pounds (EGP)‚Äã, which introduces forex risk if the EGP weakens or if there are delays converting that revenue to USD. We actually saw this concern play out in 2024: Gorilla had a huge Accounts Receivable build-up from some large projects (meaning they had delivered milestones but were waiting to get paid). This spooked some investors. The good news: as noted, they collected the majority of those receivables by August 2024‚Äã, showing that, yes, payments might be slow, but they did get paid on those deals. It required active management, but it happened. Furthermore, Gorilla‚Äôs recent cash infusion (now \~$47M in the bank) gives them breathing room to handle working capital swings. The company‚Äôs diversification across multiple countries also helps ‚Äì slow payment in one country can be offset by cash flow from others. That said, this is absolutely a risk to monitor going forward. When you invest in a company that does business in emerging markets, you have to be aware of things like government bureaucracies, political instability, and currency controls. Gorilla‚Äôs management seems aware of this (hence bringing on top auditors, collecting cash early, etc.), but it doesn‚Äôt eliminate the risk. I‚Äôd just caution that dismissing Gorilla solely because they operate in, say, Egypt or Southeast Asia might be shortsighted ‚Äì those are also regions where some of the biggest new smart-city and AI projects are happening. So it‚Äôs a risk, but it‚Äôs also where the growth is.

# Additional Note: Andre Left (Citron) Under Criminal Indictment

One interesting development that‚Äôs been circulating: an article from the U.S. Department of Justice ([Case Link](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-vns/case/united-states-v-andrew-left)) indicates that **Andrew Left**, a short seller (commonly associated with ‚Äú**Citron Research**‚Äù), was indicted in July 2024 for allegedly running a market manipulation scheme. He has pleaded not guilty, and everyone is presumed innocent until proven otherwise. Trial is set for September 30, 2025. Some are connecting this with the short attacks on GRRR, since Citron has historically published negative reports on certain companies, and The Bear Cave‚Äôs critical note on Gorilla also had a short-biased stance. In any event, if it‚Äôs true that an affiliated short seller is under indictment for market manipulation, it doesn‚Äôt automatically mean the Gorilla short thesis is invalid‚Äîbut it obviously doesn‚Äôt boost that short seller‚Äôs credibility. We‚Äôll see how it unfolds in court. **The main point: approach sensational short reports with caution, especially if the author might face credibility issues.**

**Personal Note on the Team & Transparency**  
One more thing I always look at when investing is the team behind the company. In Gorilla‚Äôs case, they‚Äôre surprisingly open and transparent‚Äîespecially CEO Jay Chandan, who posts regular updates and isn‚Äôt shy about interacting with the public. CFO David Bower (joined in 2024) also seems pretty accessible and has a track record in tech finance. Meanwhile, other board members and senior management have been quick to address rumors or speculation. Frankly, a ‚Äúshady‚Äù or ‚Äúfake‚Äù outfit wouldn‚Äôt be so active in providing regular press releases and direct comms‚Äîespecially with earnings around the corner (end of March, plus the 20-F on April 15). If Gorilla were all smoke and mirrors, it‚Äôd be madness to hype unrealistic numbers now, only to have them disproven in a few weeks.

In short, while I‚Äôm obviously not guaranteeing anything and still want to see those official revenues come in, I do like a management team that acts unafraid to engage with investors and the public. It‚Äôs not conclusive proof of legitimacy, but it beats radio silence. If you‚Äôve got a group that consistently puts out info, addresses questions head-on, and has leaders with decent resumes and experience, it doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúfly-by-night‚Äù to me. So that‚Äôs a small check in the ‚Äúplus‚Äù column until we see those real, hard numbers soon

Hope this helps anyone doing research. If you guys hsee something I missed or if I made some sort of mistake, let me know. As with all these small-cap or mid-cap growth plays, do your homework, stay cautious, and good luck."

Why is this the perfect strategy? *Because the auto industry cannot survive those tariffs.* Trump still hasn't realized this and seems dead set on bringing back those tariffs on April 2nd. I've started this strategy earlier today (see position below) and will give an update in a month. Of course if Trump gives up on the idea of tariffing the auto industry, then I will liquidate everything.

PCE comes out tomorrow.  
The bottom has fallen out, I've watched SPY V shape recovery this entire week.  
The hedge funds and market makers have been propping SPY up while they've been selling equities as to not spook the retailers.

That is why large cap stocks were tanking while SPY was only \~3% from its ATH.  
NVDA was the  last bastion of hope, we saw how big funds were more than happy to dump their position this morning and big entities have been on the sidelines for a bit.

Jamie Dimon of JPM sold 1/4 Billion dollars in shares last week.  
Warren Buffett has a record 325+ Billion in cash on the sidelines.

The crooked hedge funds and market makers have finished rotating and re-positioning.

HIDDEN BEHEMOTH V2: NIO,124,1iylpsv,https://i.redd.it/9jp21v3s1hle1.jpeg,74,2025-02-26 17:18:36,"Hey guys!

Back at it with another DD.¬† Going to keep it short as many can‚Äôt read complete sentences.¬† Nailed the last few DDs so hopefully I am right again this time.¬† ¬†I only post when I see a big opportunity.

The stock in play is **NIO**, the Chinese Premium EV Brand.¬† Yes I know, some of you are already thinking, Chinese stocks no thanks but hear me out.¬†¬† ¬†¬†To start, I moved to China for work and own a NIO ES7 and I am a firm believer.¬†

**Pros:** ¬†

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† New addressable markets with two new brands.¬† FIREFLY (low end consumer), On V0 (middle class consumer) ¬†

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ON V0 is a game changer because the current model L60 and future models are priced for the mass market.¬† ¬†\*\*They even have access to NIO‚Äôs battery swapping stations!!!\*\*¬† This is huge because right now there is no brand that currently offers battery swapping.¬† ¬†

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Battery Swapping technology is what differentiate NIO from their competitors because it takes 5 minutes to change a battery and you are on your way.¬† ¬†They just completed 1 million swaps during the two weeks from Chinese New Year.¬† The reason why Tesla abandoned the tech is because infrastructure isn‚Äôt there/too expensive, but I can tell you it works and it works flawlessly.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Owns/operate the most battery charging stations in China and along highways, the Shanghai charging/swapping operations are about to turn profitable.¬† ¬†Many EV companies use their charging stations as well.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Priced cheaply compared to all other EV Brands, yes because they are not selling as much but be greedy when others are fearful

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† US politics is a mess right now and in the near future, with DOGE and Trump creating a lot of uncertainties, I believe funds will move back to China as China is very proactive in getting investments back and is actually publicly protecting/enhancing their tech industry instead of beating them down like few yrs ago(check out Chinese equities)

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Their CEO mentioned that NIO is seeking to achieve profitability in the last quarter of 2025!!

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† They will never go bankrupt as it is backed by the government, Tencent, Abu-Dhabi‚Äôs CYVN Holdings , so there is essentially zero risk of bankruptcy

**Cons:**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Low sales numbers relative to all other brands but I firmly believe this will change as more people recognize the utility of battery swaps

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Lots of competition in Chinese EV market, but if they break through the mass market, there will be a huge upside

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† They still have very low sales outside China, so it is less vulnerable to tariff compared to other manufacturers, although they are expanding in Europe and have plans for Middle East.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Hemorrhaging cash but they aim to be profitable year end

¬†

Everything is coming together for this company.¬†¬† While other Chinese EV stocks went up a lot already like Xpeng and LI.¬† ¬†They are just amazing cars, period. ¬†Don‚Äôt look at outdated review from youtube comparing apples to oranges.¬† They are great cars.¬† I firmly because the risk/reward for this is amazing.¬† ¬†Losing 30% of your investment for have a potential for few baggers sounds absolutely amazing to me.¬† ¬†It is absolutely no brainer, just look at my last DD for Palantir, I am still holding it and at a 8 bagger as of today. ¬†¬†I put my money where my mouth is.¬† No options for me because of the high volatility right now.   

Position is 260,000 shares @ 4.63

Sorry for the long post. Good luck everyone!!

Closed my earlier position of -39 50DTE NVDA 120 cash secured puts for a small profit of $2.1k 2 days ago (date of earnings) at open. In hindsight, I should have waited until yesterday at open to close for a bigger profit but I just didn‚Äôt feel 100% comfortable with how the market would react to earnings.

Yesterday wrote 40 80DTE NVDA 110 cash secured puts for $25k premium. Maximum loss if NVDA goes to 0 is $414.7k 

Today used the premiums (and an extra $2k) to buy 25 80DTE 125 calls (should have done this yesterday at close). NVDA has been 120-150 range bound for several months. I believe yesterday‚Äôs 8% drop is an overreaction and NVDA will be in the 140 range in March. If im wrong, the calls were 90% paid by the premiums. Worst case scenario, this is basically a limit order for 4,000 shares of NVDA at $110.5 a share, and I‚Äôm happy to hold onto NVDA at that price."

Lyft to Offer Driverless Ride-Hails ‚Äòas Soon as This Summer‚Äô,112,1jfwcij,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lyft-offer-driverless-ride-hails-175137007.html,40,2025-03-21 00:20:24,"(Bloomberg) -- Lyft Inc. said it plans to offer driverless vehicles on its platform ‚Äúas soon as this summer,‚Äù and that it sees human drivers transitioning to other work such as fleet management as autonomous rides become more ubiquitous.

The company has been spending more time pitching its vision for the future of its gig-economy business model as it plays catch-up in offering autonomous rides. Driverless ride-hailing has become more commonplace in some key US markets through competing platforms. Like rival Uber Technologies Inc., Lyft envisions a hybrid future where human drivers will complement autonomous vehicle fleets, especially during periods of peak demand.

The autonomous-vehicle economy will create new jobs such as remote vehicle support, fleet management, and map data labeling and validation, said Jeremy Bird, Lyft‚Äôs executive vice president in charge of driver experience, said Thursday in a blog post. He also confirmed the driverless service could begin as early as this summer. The company had previously committed to a launch sometime in 2025.

Bird also said the idea of drivers eventually owning autonomous vehicles is core to the company‚Äôs strategy, and this will become more feasible as the cost falls for those cars. That would enable drivers to operate small fleets, not unlike how some Airbnb Inc. hosts have made a business out of renting out multiple properties. Elon Musk has a similar vision in which Tesla owners would monetize their vehicles when they aren‚Äôt personally using them.

‚ÄúEven when technology encroaches on human jobs, it doesn‚Äôt eliminate the need for humans altogether ‚Äî especially when workers can provide value that the machines cannot,‚Äù Bird wrote. ‚ÄúHumans are features, not bugs, and we‚Äôll continue to find a way to reward those that provide great service as part of a thriving hybrid network.‚Äù

Lyft and Uber currently rely on millions of drivers to quickly match with riders. But Lyft, which only operates in the US and Canada, is more exposed to increasing competition from domestic autonomous ride providers such as Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Waymo.

Waymo began offering driverless service more broadly in major markets like San Francisco and Los Angeles last year, and has partnered exclusively with Uber to offer those rides in Austin starting this month. The two companies have a similar agreement to launch driverless trips in Atlanta this summer.

When Lyft launches its first driverless trips, it will be through existing partnerships, including with Toyota Motor Corp.-backed startup May Mobility in Atlanta.

Lyft shares have declined 9% since the start of the year, while Uber‚Äôs have gained 23% so far.

Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi has gone so far as to predict that human drivers will eventually be displaced as autonomous software develops superior driving skills over the next 15 to 20 years. The company has made some early efforts to help create new earnings opportunities for its network of gig workers, including piloting a Taskrabbit-like service where customers can hire people to complete various household tasks. It‚Äôs also recruiting coders and language experts to fuel its new AI data labeling business.

In his blog post, Lyft‚Äôs Bird stopped short of predicting when drivers might be displaced, instead saying that driverless cars will create new opportunities for drivers. That includes manual work required to service, maintain and charge the vehicles. These are ‚Äújobs for which drivers are well suited,‚Äù Bird added.

The industry will also need customer service workers to respond to unusual events during driverless rides. In Lyft‚Äôs case, 30% of the staff working in its fleet management unit Flexdrive are former or current Lyft drivers, Bird wrote.

The company has also proposed ways for drivers to find jobs in other industries, offering free training to enter the tech industry. CEO David Risher also recently announced a new feature that uses AI to generate a recommendation letter, which active drivers in good standing can share with potential employers."
blackrock made a move on panama ports. they‚Äôre moving on mining/drilling next [DD],116,1j42h15,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1j42h15/blackrock_made_a_move_on_panama_ports_theyre/,46,2025-03-05 18:28:25,"I‚Äôm sure some of you heard the headlines around Panama yesterday. Blackrock announced that they led a group of private investors to purchase[ two of the surrounding ports near the canal](https://www.wsj.com/business/logistics/blackrock-strikes-23-billion-deal-for-ports-on-both-sides-of-panama-canal-d42a5b5e). The president praised the action during his televised address and you can rest assured that no part of this was a surprise to either him or the institutional investors involved in the matter.

You see, Blackrock has been aiming to become a major player in infrastructure and energy transition markets, and [recent major acquisitions in the last few months¬† ](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=blackrock+gip+acquisition)have paved the way to accomplishing that end. I‚Äôve been following them closely ever since I noticed their involvement in the mining, metals, and rare earth sector in Ukraine. I had written a separate \[DD\] explaining why I believe that sector was about to have a massive run [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1iuykwm/the_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_but/)

Presently, I want to bring your attention to the positioning and posturing made by Blackrock, as well as Trump-affiliated mining, metals, and drilling executives, ever since the November election. I believe that we will see similar involvement by that firm in the reconstruction of Ukraine, as well as in supporting mining and processing of rare minerals and metals both in that region and in the USA domestically.

**I. As you sleep, Blackrock buys, then buys, and buys some more**

In previous discussions, I mentioned a number of companies that I believe are uniquely situated to benefit dramatically from private and governmental support in the western rare earth supply chain, especially at mid-stream, including MP materials which is [presently the only american company that is operational in their mining, extracting, and processing of rare earth,](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3700059/dod-looks-to-establish-mine-to-magnet-supply-chain-for-rare-earth-materials/) especially when it comes to the heavy minerals deemed most essential to our national security.

Would you like to know something curious? [Blackrock acquired a 10% stake of MP](https://fintel.io/so/us/mp) with haste after Trump‚Äôs election. A few days following the election, Gina Rinehart, a mining magnate, Australia‚Äôs richest women, and close friend to the president, also acquired an [8.5% stake of MP](https://fintel.io/i/hancock-prospecting-pty-ltd) through a new investment group created under Hancock Prospecting in Q4 2024.  Rinehart had previously been in discussion with MP materials over a potential merger that would see MP materials and Lynas Rare Earth [(a company that Rinehart has significant ownership in as well](https://www.mining.com/web/australian-billionaire-gina-rinehart-buys-stake-in-rare-earths-producer-lynas/) and which is the largest producer of rare earth outside China) combine forces to create a unified company capable of posing a serious threat to [Chinese stranglehold over the chain](https://www.google.com/search?q=mp+and+lynas+rinehart&client=firefox-b-1-d&sca_esv=b3124e538ea91f17&sxsrf=AHTn8zp30_wTmF7gaP7WD3QbzwF6FDOmDw%3A1741175001245&ei=2TjIZ93gDqeJptQPx7TfoAQ&ved=0ahUKEwidscOr7vKLAxWnhIkEHUfaF0QQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=mp+and+lynas+rinehart&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiFW1wIGFuZCBseW5hcyByaW5laGFydDIFECEYoAFI-gdQigFYlAdwAXgAkAEBmAGqAaABnAeqAQM2LjO4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgegAsYFwgIFECEYqwKYAwCIBgGSBwMzLjSgB5kY&sclient=gws-wiz-serp). The idea, as far as I know, was that Lynas would wind down operations in Australia and begin significant investments scaling with MP in the United states. This aligns with present administration efforts to support the domestic chain. In fact, Lynas has a contract with the federal government to build a processing plant in the US anyways.

I have to say that convergence between institutions like Blackrock and private equity in recent months in this sector do not stop at MP or Lynas. Here is a list of some companies that I have been interested in within the mining, metals and rare earth minerals sector, as well as the corresponding ownership stake taken by Blackrock and other investors in recent months:

>**MP Materials**: 9.50% Blackrock, 8.5% Rinehart (15% of Rinehart‚Äôs portfolio)  
**UUUU:** 8% Blackrock; Rinehart also invested  
**LAC**: 5% Blackrock; Rinehart also invested  
**TECK**: 6.6% Blackrock, 2% Rinehart (20% of Rineharts portfolio)  
**TTEK -** 9.7% Blackrock, tripled stake in company in February, 2025. Ken Griffin  
**HES -** 8.5% Blackrock; Citadel CEO Ken Griffin also increased his share by ‚Ä¶¬† 26,099,166% üòÇ  
**TSLA** \- 5% Blackrock, Q4 they added more shares of TSLA than any other stock; RH

Blackrock has also quietly been making significant acquisitions of shares of [Endeavour Mining](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/03/03/3035908/0/en/Endeavour-Announces-Holding-s-in-Company.html) as recently as in March 2025 and I have also found institutional support for a number of related sectors, such as VAL for offshore drilling infrastructure.

Rinehart had also invested 7% into an Argentinian Lithium company in Q4, 2025. She appears close with the president of Argentina, actually. They took a selfie together at the inauguration party in DC.

[Rinehart with Argentina's President, Javier Milei](https://preview.redd.it/6dvpy9obcvme1.jpg?width=1092&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ccc8573d3792788b629ff2bb29300f702c0497e7)

I wonder if there are any looming partnerships in the works? I bet so.

**II. Rampant Speculation**

The president has promised dramatic action in mining and resource production in the USA in the coming week. He mentioned it on his address to the senate last night. I doubt it was news to the institutionally powerful, though, in the same way that I doubt it is a coincidence that short put interest on MP has been \~12,000 w/ expiry mid-march, [only to then dramatically fall off the cliff for expiry mid-april.](https://fintel.io/sopt/us/mp)¬†

I wonder what will happen? Here is some rampant speculation: MP‚Äôs CEO has reduced his share to a feeble 9.5% stake in the company whilst Blackrock and Rinehart have increased there‚Äôs to match. **I would not be surprised if we see Blackrock, Rinehart/Hancock, and MP working together to dramatically scale USA rare earth production.** This would also fit with language in executive order on minerals and mining, leaning on Quadrilateral Security Partners.

I also found the positioning with LAC particularly interesting given that they are awaiting approval for the largest [north american lithium mine](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/LAC/lithium-americas-increases-mineral-resource-and-reserve-for-thacker-dvrd2ok6wzyj.html). They are also partnered with GM. I wonder how direct private equity investment and further deregulation and government expediting of the usual processes may impact this company, and with what timeline? I think we see movement sooner rather than later, but I‚Äôm just some guy.

Anyways, here are my positions:

Tl;dr: Firms like blackrock have positioned themselves to take considerable control over the American rare earth and metals supply chain. Top tickers atthe moment based on this \[DD\] include: MP, UUUU, American Lithium, TECK.

QQQ 490 6/20 calls - when J POW has your back then it‚Äôs time to be greedy when others are fearful,105,1j62098,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j62098,51,2025-03-08 03:50:40,"Closed 75 spy 606 5/18 puts on 3/4 when I felt market was oversold, and have been looking for an opportunity to buy calls to take advantage of an oversold market. Picked up 45 qqq 490 6/20 calls right before J Powell‚Äôs speech as a gamble on my feeling that market is oversold, and sentiment is too fearful. 

Below are some statements made by Powell that indicated his sentiment that things aren‚Äôt too bad right now, and also reassured me that the Fed will step in if things get too bad.

‚ÄúWhile there have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high. As we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúIf the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy accordingly. Our current policy stance is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.‚Äù

Powell takes his dual mandate very seriously, those of you whom traded back in 2020 remember the fed being instrumental to pulling the levers needed to protect the economy, encourage lending, which ultimately led to a v shaped market recovery in 04/2020. If things get bad enough (I don‚Äôt think they will), or policies become even more unpredictable (I‚Äôm not holding my breathe), Powell will step in again to uphold his mandate and protect our economy, and our investment portfolios.

I entered another good till cancelled limit order for 55 qqq 490 6/20 at $20. If it is not exercised that‚Äôs okay, if it is, then I get to ‚Äúbuy the dip.‚Äù I plan to hold on to my calls until qqq crosses 525,  or market sentiment significantly improves, whichever comes sooner. At that point I will go back to holding puts to hedge.

"$IONQ AND $RGTI - Why NVIDIA Quantum Day is their ""Red Wedding"" Event",95,1j8uv2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1j8uv2o/ionq_and_rgti_why_nvidia_quantum_day_is_their_red/,177,2025-03-11 21:58:45,"[DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/?f=flair_name%3A%22DD%22)

In their latest earnings call, while they had revenue from research collaborations, both IONQ and RGTI do not have a commercially viable product, nor do they even have a realistic timeline to one. Both claim, maybe 2030...and quantum computers have always been ""5 more years!""

Some facts - The RGTI CEO is focused on fidelity - improving accuracy a projected 2x this year! To be commercially viable ""like an NVIDIA GPU"" requires 100,000,000 X accuracy gains...

Quantum Advantage is not a given at lower fidelity rates either.

The commercial TAMS they claim Quantum will help are not limited by compute (drug discovery, networking, crypto, NFTs, AI, etc.)

And now we get to the event coming up; NVIDIA's Quantum Day.

These stocks went into free fall when Jensen and Zuckerberg admitted quantum tech is many decades out from relevance.

Jensen then saved them by stating he was going to host quantum day; MSFT the same day announced for companies to be ""quantum ready for 2025!"" in a blog post.

We have to ask ourselves why? And what is happening at quantum day?

The WHY behind NVDA and MSFT is simple - right after this hype marketing on quantum, MSFT reported dissapointing cloud sales to enterprise. MSFT cap-ex on NVIDIA GPUS is dependent on these units sales. MSFT offers the ability to play around with these quantum computers on their cloud for research purposes - though they are typically down and worthless but they do consume a TON of compute.

This not only marked the top of the market because why would MSFT and NVDA need to pump quantum if AI is going HAM? It's an act of desperation by their marketing teams, simple as.

Finally the coup de grace - QUANTUM DAY (RED WEDDING)

Who is the guest on the same level as NVDA? Crowdstrike. Why? Because the only real application for quantum computers long term is encryption breaking...important for security. The only issue here is; Crowdstrike is invested in avoiding that for their customers so they will DEFINITELY outline how they will invalidate this technology.

When the market realizes the only potential use for quantum in decades will be invalidated by tech from players like CRWD, its a headshot.

To add insult to injury, IONQ's CEO who is attending the NVDIA conference has been comparing themselves to 2015 NVIDIA...claiming Jensen is afraid of them...lol

This CEO is a serial SPACer and midwit.

Enjoy shorting this or buy puts. I think all will work out. Not financial advice. Maybe buy some short term calls to hedge.

Short with April hedges.

It was crazy watching the entire market tank last week and JNJ was one of the only stocks to see 2% gains daily.

Just rode it up until what I thought might be the peak today. Even if it keeps running, I‚Äôm happy with my gains. I was hoping it would go to 170, but it could go either way at this point so I just sold out.

This was the perfect stock to gain experience in letting the winners run. The stock is not very volatile so I could hold out on some of the down days. But fortunately the down days were very small, but up days were big. And the last week just shot up.

"In a gold rush, sell shovels. In a period of POTUS-induced volatility, buy IBKR options.",88,1iwx9kp,https://i.redd.it/fa2qjsgdr1le1.jpeg,35,2025-02-24 13:53:34,"Anyone following IBKR over the last year knows that their line goes pretty consistently up. I have made money before by buying ITM options on IBKR dips, so I entered again on Thursday. Was 2k in profit before Friday's mini meltdown but I carried on buying most of the way down. Now it looks like I have a YOLO on my hands.

My rationale is as follows:

IBKR is a good broker, and is taking over from RH as the regards' broker of choice. You don't even have to get in your car or risk getting a restraining order for stalking a cashier (in true WSB style) to find this out. Just count the number of IBKR screenshots posted on here. They used to be rare, now they're very common. 

As well as an increasing number of customers, they make money from commissions, margin loans to degenerates, and paying Fed rate minus .5% to those enjoying a fleeting moment of glory and holding their fat stacks with them. Commissions and margin loans basically means they make money from volatility. This was reiterated in their last earnings report.

Sell everything and go all cash when you see Elon's offspring using the Oval Office as a playpen? IBKR makes money. Cash out US stocks to buy EU defence stocks in a patriotic fervour? IBKR makes money. Go all in with margin on TQQQ calls when the President calls off his own tariff war? IBKR makes money.

They publish monthly metrics so you don't need to wait for earnings for confirmation they are doing well. In January they did well. Metrics for this month will be out early March and I can't imagine they will be bad.

This should get back in the mid 230s before long. IV is relatively low, so I'm holding 15 x 210C for next month's expiry. If this is the beginning of a market downtrend I'm fucked, but I suppose that goes for most of us.

Tl;dr - IBKR is a good broker, is growing anyway, and does especially well in periods of volatility. IBKR's numbers wull be fine, but downside risk is that if SPY keeps drilling I'm gonna get gaped.

DD: ET (Energy Transfer - midstream) LEAP opportunities,88,1iwpboj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1iwpboj/dd_et_energy_transfer_midstream_leap_opportunities/,54,2025-02-24 06:12:40,"This post is calling out some primo LEAP opportunities for the midstream stock ET.  

I‚Äôm loaded with Jan 2026 Calls for the strike price of $22 and $25. This post is a play on the bullish case for domestic US energy/oil.

**Highlights for why you might be interested:**

* Recent agreement reached with a tech company I‚Äôve never heard of: [CloudBurst Data Centers on Feb 10th](https://ir.energytransfer.com/news-releases/news-release-details/energy-transfer-and-cloudburst-sign-agreement-natural-gas-supply). This is the first publicly made agreement and a significant precedent for partnerships in midstream at this scale. ET supposedly [‚Äúhas requests from more than 70 prospective data centers in 12 states.""](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/02/19/energy-transfer-looks-to-turbocharge-growth-spendi/)  Everyone knows nuclear companies are eventually going to be the standard, but that‚Äôs only if the industry can get there in 5+ years. When the OKLO and friends bubble pops, Tech companies will need to be realistic about how to get their energy and pivot to domestic energy sourcing: enter ET  
* Biden banned [new off-shore drilling in the US just before leaving office](https://news.mongabay.com/short-article/president-biden-bans-offshore-oil-and-gas-drilling-for-many-u-s-waters). Why do you think Trump is calling the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America? It‚Äôs so that we can be confident drilling in our own backyard again. If this executive order is revered, midstream is positioned to capitalize on any increase of drilling.  
* ET is putting [$5 billion into growth over 2025, up $3 billion from 2024](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/energy-transfer-earnings-growth-2024-sets-up-an-impressive-outlook-2025-27). More growth === more fees === more profit for investors. As well, In their recent Q$ earnings, [ET saw it‚Äôs EBITDA grow 8%](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/02/19/energy-transfer-looks-to-turbocharge-growth-spendi/), and forecast a continued increase for the 2025 fiscal year. This is important since EBITDA is the main metric that midstream companies use to grow.  
* ET currently trades at an enterprise value (EV)-to-EBITDA multiple of about 8.5 times the high end of its 2025 guidance. While its valuation has risen, it's still significantly where it traded before the pandemic.

"A Guide to the Biggest ""IPO"" in History: trashy DD on FNMA and FMCC",73,1je4hzm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1je4hzm,66,2025-03-18 18:36:36,"The guide to the biggest ‚ÄúIPO‚Äù in history

Hello my highly regarded denizens, and let me introduce you to the upcoming insanity that will be surrounding the release of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from the bowels of hell, government bureaucracy, and the OTC. I‚Äôm going to lead off with a few basic ways to play this, what kind of red flags I‚Äôll be looking for, and some background and context in case you‚Äôre not familiar with this HIGHLY unusual situation.

First off, there are two securities you can buy here. The first are the common stock: FNMA and FMCC, for each of the companies. You need to think of these as call options with no theta and delta 1. I‚Äôm personally weighted heavily towards these since Inauguration but I‚Äôll get more into that momentarily. Then there are the junior preferred shares, each of which correspond to one of the companies and usually share the first few letters: FNMAS, FNMAT, FNMAJ for Fannie, and FMCCH, FMCKJ, and FMCCO for Freddie. 

In case you‚Äôve been living under a rock or are an active subscriber of The Motley Fool, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the two most profitable companies by employee, and have the largest assets on the face of fucking planet. That‚Äôs seven and a half TRILLION dollars in assets. They buy up mortgages from banks, dump ‚Äòem together in a various pots called securitizations, and basically print money from the payments. Back in 08, the government made a determination based on secret filings that Fannie and Freddie were super dangerous, and would have to print their earnings directly into the Treasury department instead. At the head of this conservatorship, and controlling Fannie and Freddie is the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

Currently, the US Treasury Department owns a million shares of the Senior Preferred Shares (SPS) at a value of around $200 billion. They ALSO own warrants, equal to diluting the common stock by 80%. The Treasury awarded themselves these shares and warrants after forcing Fannie and Freddie to take a loan out on hypothetical losses in 08, and there‚Äôs only three men who can do anything about that. Thankfully, they have a raging boner of hatred for the government.

Junior Preferred Shares (JPS) and commons are both available to common investors, but only through the OTC, so Robinhooders are in shambles (again). JPS are more protected but have capped upside; they have a par value (aka a cap in price) of either $25 or $50, and if dividends get turned on again (only after a release, covered below), they get up to 8% of par first, and then commons get the rest. There‚Äôs also a fun added bonus round just to make things more complex: JPS and Freddie commons (but not FNMA) will be getting damages awarded after the presiding judge decided to sign off (after waiting TWO years, and yes, you read that right). FMCKJ will be getting something like $3 in damages, and as of 3/17, was trading at $10. 

Then there‚Äôs common shares. High risk, ultra high reward. Depending on what kind of scenario plays out, we could see share price hitting anything from sub $2 if you believe somnambulant lawyers, to $34 if you believe Bill Ackman, to price targets that you wouldn‚Äôt fucking believe until I lay it all.

Right now, here‚Äôs the main events:

Relist: Currently commons and JPS languish in OTC purgatory. 20% pops and drops on zero news, zero halts, and lower liquidity than your mother in her memory care unit. Shambles. Rather than an IPO, the companies can follow a much simpler uplisting procedure to the NYSE This will allow institutions to buy who are restricted from OTC trading, as well as making positions marginable, including OPTIONS. Theoretically, they can uplist at any moment.
Recap: based on arbitrary regulations, Fannie and Freddie have to have some certain amount of money to backstop the loans they guarantee. How much you ask? It entirely depends on who‚Äôs in charge? Back when Mark Calabria was running things, they needed like 4.5% of their book as a reserve! Good thing that those capital requirements didn‚Äôt stop payments from running straight out of Fannie and Freddie‚Äôs wallet into untraceable Treasury accounts! The specific phrase you need to parsing Twitter headlines is ‚ÄúECRF‚Äù, which stands for ‚ÄúEverybody Chill, Release Fannie,‚Äù letting you know that if the amount is 1.5%, Fannie will be released within a year (it‚Äôs just under the capital threshold). If it‚Äôs lower than 1.5%, Fannie can be released IMMEDIATELY. Freddie is a little slower, but he works just as hard you guys, and he won‚Äôt be far too far behind. 
Release: dividends get turned back on, justice is restored, and angelic choirs announce the golden age of America.

So let me give a couple of the RED FLAGS for free. If you see these, FLEE commons. 
Warrant Exercise. We know you‚Äôve been trying hard to forget that reminder about your license being suspended, but this is definitely one warrant you can‚Äôt escape. Diluting the float by 80% would absolutely murder commons with no real hope of reprieve. Your only saving grace might be that OTC tends to trade headlines a day or two slow. 
SPS conversion. Just like a regular conversion, this one will also have you on your knees begging for mercy. Basically another form of dilution.
‚ÄúNeed for continued study.‚Äù You know how when you had that hot band chick over to study, and you kept trying to touch her hand while going over AP Calc homework, but she got angry that you weren‚Äôt paying enough attention to what SHE thought was important? This is like that. Without significant internal pressure, government impetus will stop any relist/recap/release movement simply out of being the fact that they‚Äôre collectively lazy and stupid. Given that midterms are going to be a distraction for decision makers only 15 months from now, progress needs to be made, and quickly, before GOP control of all three branches is threatened. Specifically, while some of these comments were made by Scott Bessent (now Treasury Secretary) and Bill Pulte (now FHFA Director), that was before they were confirmed, and based on everything I‚Äôm seeing, were statements to basically placate the committees. To get released, these companies will need specific and meaningful policy decisions.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm IMAGINING for green flags. Seriously, there hasn‚Äôt been a lot of public statements made about these companies, but I think for good reasons, mainly political.
SPS CANCELLED. There‚Äôs several good reasons to believe the Treasury‚Äôs stock will just straight go to zero. First, the Treasury has been MORE than paid back on the loans they gave going back to 08; altogether, they got paid $340 billion over a $200 billion loan. This raises serious questions about why the government can simply continue to demand money from organizations it ‚Äòconserves,‚Äô which was one reason why a jury voted 8-0 to give damages in the Fairholme case. The continued existence of SPS brings into question the very notion of property rights in America.
Warrants to be sold. There‚Äôs a lot of speculation about what the Treasury would do with the warrants after a recap/relist. A popular theory is that the Treasury could gradually sell these assets off, and allocate the money to whatever pet project. This seems pretty likely, given talk about a Sovereign Wealth Fund, and similar procedures with confiscated bitcoins etc. There‚Äôs some interesting dynamics where warrants could be sold to fund a SWF, which funds real estate development, which pumps FnF, raising warrant values higher, etc.
Warrants to be CANCELLED. The ultimate bull case. If this happens, commons will launch to Mars and legends will be made. Some say the ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù would never go for this. I say the government is run by the same man who brought us TRUMPCOIN on Inauguration weekend, and we can‚Äôt even know if he has a position since filings on OTC are VOLUNTARY. Sure would be quite an ARTFUL DEAL if the decision maker about FHFA actions just so happened to have a position.

So where are we at with this?
Trump: a man with significant real estate holdings and a desire to eliminate government agencies wholesale.
Bessent: confirmed Treasury Secretary with a desire to privatize everything in sight.
Pulte: confirmed FHFA director, who on the first day, declared himself Chairman of the Board for FnF and cleared house on the board. 
At this point I‚Äôm basically just waiting for an announcement. It will probably come from Bessent who will declare something about having made an agreement with Pulte to wind down FHFA, but I wouldn‚Äôt put it past Trump to announce an executive order just ending it, a la USAID. There hasn‚Äôt been much specifically said, but there is a forest of legal red tape surrounding this thing. While there could be progress made on the legal front (final motion in Fairholme damages was finally dismissed after waiting two years, and the case still isn‚Äôt even certified!), this is ultimately a political question and it seems like all the stars have aligned. 

Positions: I've been selling JPS to capture some more volatility out of commons, I plan to rotate around a bit. 

""But you're already up a lot"" dipshit, tell me if it makes any sense for a $3 dividend to trade at $6. 

""You just want exit liquidity"" you just want to be able to breathe through your nose, but that doesn't stop you from buying BABA with less volume on the NYSE than EITHER Fannie or Freddie on the OTC.

**Catalyst:** FDA **Priority Review** for first-in-class **DMD therapy** ‚Äì **PDUFA date Aug 31, 2025**

**TL;DR:** üöÄ **FDA decision coming in August for a rare disease therapy** with **no direct competition.** Company **fully funded till 2027** (so **no rug-pull dilution** incoming), has a **big pharma partner handling commercialization,** and analysts are **way more bullish than the market.** Meanwhile, **shorts are betting against it despite FDA giving it the fast lane.** If this goes through, üí∞üí∞. If it fails, üíÄ.

This is **a classic biotech play**: **under-the-radar, asymmetric risk/reward, and trading like it‚Äôs already dead when it‚Äôs not.** So, why hasn‚Äôt this thing **mooned** yet?

**üéØ The Big Catalyst ‚Äì FDA‚Äôs Priority Review**

**WTF Happened?**

On **March 4, 2025**, Capricor ($CAPR) announced that the **FDA accepted its BLA** (Biologics License Application) for **Deramiocel** (CAP-1002), an investigational **cell therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) cardiomyopathy.**

üí° **Key FDA facts:**

‚úÖ **Priority Review** ‚Äì This means **FDA cut the review time from 10 months to 6.** VIP fast lane. üèéÔ∏è

‚úÖ **PDUFA date set for Aug 31, 2025** ‚Äì The final decision deadline. üóìÔ∏è

‚úÖ **No review issues flagged yet.** No AdCom (yet). If **no AdCom by summer,** that‚Äôs bullish. üöÄ

‚úÖ **If approved, it would be the first therapy specifically for DMD heart disease.**

**Why It Matters**

üë∂ **DMD is a brutal genetic disorder that leads to early death (heart failure in teens/20s).**

üíä **There are NO approved drugs for the heart problems in DMD.** Deramiocel could **extend lives.**

üìà **FDA already fast-tracked this under multiple designations** (RMAT, Orphan, Rare Pediatric).

üí° The FDA doesn‚Äôt hand out **Priority Review & Rare Disease incentives** unless they think the drug **has a real shot.**

**The Stock‚Äôs Reaction? Total Apathetic Shrug. ü§®**

When **FDA acceptance was announced**, CAPR **barely moved (+3% close).** This was after a **pre-market +14% spike.** Instead of üöÄ, we got‚Ä¶ meh.

**WTF?**

**ü§î Why Is This Still Trading Like a Penny Stock?**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **BLA Acceptance Was ‚ÄúPriced In‚Äù** ‚Äì CAPR ran from **\~$4 to the mid-teens** in late 2024 as traders **anticipated** the FDA submission. So **no new buying frenzy.**

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Shorts Are Doubting FDA Approval** ‚Äì There‚Äôs a **high short interest (\~20% of the float)**, likely betting **FDA will demand more data.**

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Biotech Market Sentiment is Trash Right Now** ‚Äì The sector is struggling. Risk-off mode.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Earnings Are Coming ‚Äì Guidance Will Matter** ‚Äì Market might be waiting to hear about cash burn & commercialization plans.

üí° **Why is the borrow rate climbing?** That means **hedgies are paying more to bet against this.**

**üí∞ The Financials ‚Äì No Dilution Incoming (Unlike Most Biotech Wrecks)**

Most **small-cap biotechs bleed out before FDA decisions** because they need **cash injections (= stock offerings = price nukes).** But CAPR **doesn‚Äôt need money until at least 2027.**

üí∞ **Cash:** \~$175M (after big 2024 raise)

üî• **Runway:** 2027 (even at high burn)

üìâ **No Debt / No ATM Financing** ‚Äì No surprise 5pm ‚Äúsurprise dilution‚Äù announcements.

üí∏ **Partner Funding:** Nippon Shinyaku (Japanese pharma) has **already invested $15M in equity** at a 20% premium & will handle global commercialization.

üöÄ **If Deramiocel gets FDA approval, CAPR gets:**

‚úÖ **$100M+ just from selling the Priority Review Voucher** (PRV)

‚úÖ **Milestone payments from Nippon Shinyaku ($705M total potential)**

‚úÖ **Royalties on sales** (double-digit %)

**üî• The Big Question: What‚Äôs the Market Missing?**

üîç **Current Market Cap:** \~$580M

üìä **Analysts‚Äô Price Targets:** **$34-$77**

üëÄ **Short Interest:** \~8.16M shares (20.4% of float)

üìà **Stock Should Be Priced Higher If Approval Odds Are Good**

**üìú Biotech Playbook: Past FDA Approval Trades**

‚úîÔ∏è **Sarepta (SRPT) 2016 ‚Äì 131% gain in one month** when their DMD drug got approved despite a shaky FDA panel.

‚úîÔ∏è **Spark (ONCE) 2017 ‚Äì FDA approval ‚Üí Acquired by Roche for $4.3B.**

‚úîÔ∏è **Krystal Biotech (KRYS) 2023 ‚Äì Ran from \~$70 to $130 pre-FDA approval.**

üöÄ **CAPR is following a similar setup.**

**üé≤ The Play ‚Äì How Degenerates Could Trade This**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Run-Up Trade:** Buy shares/calls leading into August & sell before FDA decision.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Binary Bet:** Hold through the PDUFA for **moonshot approval or fiery death.**

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Straddle/Strangle:** If you expect a **massive move** but not sure which way.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Wheel It:** Sell cash-secured puts to collect premium from high IV.

**If approved,** this could be a **multi-bagger stock overnight.** If rejected, üíÄ.

**üö® Final Ape Thoughts**

üî• **FDA Priority Review isn‚Äôt given out lightly.**

üî• **No competing therapies exist.**

üî• **CAPR is fully funded into 2027, so dilution isn‚Äôt a near-term risk.**

üî• **Stock is undervalued compared to potential payout.**

üöÄ **The trade? If the market realizes this is actually a solid biotech setup, it could run. If not, the PDUFA itself will be the make-or-break moment.**

ü¶ç **Who else is loading up? Let‚Äôs discuss.**

**üìå TL;DR**

Based on my own research I see Palantir as being similar to Apple in that once you onboard with them you need to stay in their ecosystem as the cost to change is punitive. 

Like Apple it offers a premium suite of services that are not unique but their ecosystem offering is unique. In this way it has a moat. 

Also, it has a massive advantage over competitors as it is B2G first and then B2B second. Also, the DOGE move is bullish as it will further its entrenchment within government systems as Musk pushes to modernize and centralize government data systems.

I figured it could be of use to some of you here who don't already know. 


For determining if stocks are in favor over safe haven assets I use
SPY/GLD 
SPY/TLT
These represent the flow of capital and the relative performance of the stock market to gold, and to bonds. When gold and bonds are starting to outperform stocks on a longer time frame like the weekly chart it is a warning sign. And historically the start of a multi year/decade long trend. These things play out over a long time. Which is good because it gives us time to react. The other helpful indicator is XLY/XLP which is consumer discretionary vs consumer staples. Think Amazon, apple, etc. Vs walmart, proctor and gamble, etc. When consumers are tapped and cut back on discretionary spending this ratio chart will show it. Consumers have to still buy staples like food, toilet paper, etc. And so money flows to safety in these stocks as well. (Although they typically only do well for a limited time prior to crashes and don't necessarily rise in market downturns, they just fall less)

From here if we determine that safe haven assets are starting to outperform its pretty easy and simple on what to do. Move capital out of stocks and into cash, bonds, and gold. How much into each is discretionary and kinda up to you on how much risk you are willing to take on by holding risk assets vs safe havens.

If we determine that stocks are in favor over safe havens, typically during the growth phase of the business cycle and after major market/economic corrections and crashes. This happens when liquidity is pumped into the system via central banks printing money and government issuing debt. They do this to stimulate the economy, create inflation and This is the time to take on risk and buy risk assets. Through out the bullmarket you will see different sectors out perform and to identify that I use a couple different ratios.
I like QQQ/DIA to determine if the market likes growth vs value and
IWM/SPY to identify market cap outperformance.

And then you can go all the way into the nitty gritty of sectors and in any combination you can compare these names to each other or to the broad market via the SPY

"The $PARA Situation Has Become Much, Much More Interesting",60,1j5tnun,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1j5tnun/the_para_situation_has_become_much_much_more/,63,2025-03-07 22:34:27,"Since my last post ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ishu2q/para_yolo_undervalued_giant_with_massive_upside/)) there have been some very important developments in $PARA‚Äôs price action and merger.

¬†

I originally wrote my DD post when $PARA was at about $10.60, and didn‚Äôt finish and post it until $PARA had broken out to about $11.30. Between the time I started writing my thesis on Paramount‚Äôs bull case (and opened my first position at $10.51) and now, the price has rallied about 12%. I believe that the price action during this time has confirmed my bull case and an important part of my original DD that I intentionally left out to wait for confirmation. Keep in mind that this bullish trend has taken place in a highly volatile selloff of the market. If SPY can turn bullish, I don‚Äôt see why $PARA wouldn‚Äôt FLY. Shoot, it may even flyt with the market still being a turd.

¬†

**Summary of the technicals:**

The daily golden cross just happened as of 3/7/25.¬†From a technical perspective, this is one of the most bullish signs you can find on a chart.

https://preview.redd.it/a4t6166hmbne1.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa41fc47b31ec6d535f9dbba6a573419b6eae18f

Now for the important pattern that I have been monitoring extremely closely: we‚Äôve just passed the Last Point of Supply in what I think is one of the cleanest Wyckoff Accumulation patterns I‚Äôve ever seen

https://preview.redd.it/b5yzgczhmbne1.png?width=2384&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a9a7770452ea15363e339a484d9988b60edcdb5

Daily RSI has just reentered the bull zone, trendline is heavily bullish.

¬†

Daily ADX looks fantastic. This bullish trend is still just getting started.

https://preview.redd.it/e627bftjmbne1.png?width=2384&format=png&auto=webp&s=63ad3818ecfed45c1580acc5f07b7d72c8105445

¬†

¬†

**Non-technicals:**

We passed earnings and it was a non-event. Paramount+ memberships rose 3.5 million in the quarter, and revenue was just shy of $8B. Still absurdly undervalued, in part due to the impending merger and presumed dilution from it. But wait, because there is important merger news‚Ä¶.

If you recall from my previous post, the collapse of the merger would lead to the unwinding of a HUGE bearish position and arbitrage play that has been set up. About $43M in bearish puts, and 11% short interest (71.5M shares). Between the two, 45% of the free float is exposed to a short position.

Well, it was just announced that a judge may be putting a halt on the merger:¬†[Judge may consider blocking Paramount-Skydance deal¬† | Reuters](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Fmarkets%2Fdeals%2Fjudge-may-consider-blocking-paramount-skydance-deal-2025-03-06%2F&data=05%7C02%7C%7Cb12ce176bce4459807be08dd5cfa05c8%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638768951119773025%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=T9VAcDw4HsBM%2FIHt951aK6k0xWOYaDxWLYNisSVQ%2Bkw%3D&reserved=0)

The above article also indicates that the merger has 2 weeks before closure (3/20 at the earliest), and that there is up to 6 months of potential delays depending on FCC approval and court proceedings (further sources indicate that the FCC review will almost certainly take until the summer). My belief is that this 3/20 date will come and go without closure. If litigation continues (it will) and the maximum delay of 6 months plays out, then that‚Äôs a long time to hold a bleeding short position‚Ä¶.

**Lets also consider the following scenario:** if the judge determines that the offer from Skydance was, in fact, an unfair offer for shareholders due to the immediate dilution expected upon closure and the premium paid to Shari Redstone and Skydance, this would likely cause Paramount to pursue and accept the PRP offer (details below), which has NO risk of dilution and strengthens the balance sheet of $PARA significantly. It is a fundamentally better offer, and if it goes through, then the stock will become completely unbound from the assumed downside risk and can be free to experience true price discovery. Cue the RAPID unwinding of short positions.

PRP offer: [Project Rise Partners Issues Open Letter to Paramount Shareholders](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/project-rise-partners-issues-open-155600007.html)

PRP is actively involved in litigation: [Project Rise Partners Submits Friend of the Court Brief](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/project-rise-partners-submits-friend-161300147.html)

Oh, what‚Äôs this‚Ä¶ [Judge opens door to possible bidding war for Paramount as it scrambles to close $8B Skydance merger](https://nypost.com/2025/03/04/business/judge-opens-door-to-possible-bidding-war-for-paramount-as-it-scrambles-to-close-8b-skydance-merger/) a whistleblower?

Is there any basis to the claims of a breach of fiduciary responsibility and corruption as part of this deal? Well the courts are indicating that there may be: [Paramount Ordered to Release Skydance Merger Records to Investor](https://www.thewrap.com/paramount-ordered-skydance-merger-records-release-pension-fund-shari-redstone/) and [NYC pension funds sue to delay Paramount-Skydance deal pending court review of alleged fiduciary breach | Pensions & Investments](https://www.pionline.com/courts/nyc-pension-funds-sue-delay-paramount-skydance-deal-pending-court-review-alleged-fiduciary)

¬†We‚Äôve seen short positions get blown up in these situations before‚Äîwhen retail exposes the imbalance and institutions have to scramble to close their positions. PRP‚Äôs deal could be the catalyst that triggers the unwinding of short positions and explosive price action, and momentum behind the PRP deal is building. Even the faintest hint of it being a possibility, and the stock has risen 5.5% this week despite the S&P continuing to sell off.

And the Trump lawsuit is close to being settled or tossed out entirely (surprise, surprise‚Ä¶ it was utter nonsense to begin with):¬†[Paramount Moves to Throw Out Trump‚Äôs ‚Äô60 Minutes‚Äô Suit: ‚ÄòAn Affront to the First Amendment‚Äô](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aol.com%2Fparamount-moves-throw-trump-60-211905457.html&data=05%7C02%7C%7Cb12ce176bce4459807be08dd5cfa05c8%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638768951119803261%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=1xa8zOzuYaYxM1sU7pauA6WU4OL4wJAhKJ6HvX%2BuZHY%3D&reserved=0) ‚Äì this was never something to take seriously, but a few people brought it up on my previous post.

¬†

The wheels are turning, and I believe that this is one of those very few trades that can be life changing if it unfolds how I believe it may. Retail needs to rally behind the stock, spread the truth about the PRP offer and corrupt SD offer, and pressure the courts to demand fairness for $PARA shareholders. So, my ask of you is this: share this DD and help the truth get out. If it does and pressure mounts, then PARA is primed to do something very special.

*\*Quick disclaimer\* - I know WSB takes the whole short squeeze thing very sarcastically these days. While that is a generally reasonable perspective, this is a deep value play that has a heavily imbalanced short position that will need to be unwound if the presumed dilution is no longer a factor. I did not buy this stock because of the short position, and nor should you. It's merely an exciting thing to ponder the possibility of.*

$DNUT: The Panic is Leaving me Glazed and Confused,57,1j0e6su,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1j0e6su/dnut_the_panic_is_leaving_me_glazed_and_confused/,79,2025-02-28 23:39:45,"Krispy Kreme (DNUT) has recently had it's donut hole pounded, with the stock declining over 30% this week following ""poor"" earnings and ratings downgrades. It is now hovering at an all-time low, and in the past year has declined from $17.84 (!!) to where it is now at \~$6. I'm calling the bottom here, and will lay out why sprinkling some DNUT in your portfolio might make you Kreme your pants in a couple years.

# The Cyber Incident in December

On Dec. 11, 2024, the company announced in an 8k filing that they have been hacked. Unauthorized activity on it's information systems disrupted online ordering, and in their Q4 earnings report announced that this resulted in a *material revenue loss of $11 million*. Hole-y shit. The good news is that the donut in IT who allowed this to happen is most likely terminated, and this should be seen as a one off incident.

# Q4 Earnings: Donut Worry, the Worst is Behind Us

Even so, DNUT persisted and still managed to post their 18th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth, with yearly revenue at 1.65B, and quarterly revs 404m (Would have been 415m if they didn't get hacked). Sure, net revenue in the US declined, but that is also due to the sale of Insomnia Cookies by the company a ($57.4 million impact). Management is really focused on making their main brand bigger and better, so letting go of Insomnia makes sense. What doesn't make sense, is the downward guidance, with management believing 2025's Net Revenue to be around $1.55-$1.65 billion. To be blunt- this is sandbagged, and I am betting 2025 will return to the upward growth of past years thanks to a newer CEO taking significant action in making US businesses more capital light and restructuring management teams.

Past DNUT Net Revenue:

2021: $1.28B

2022: $1.53B

2023: $1.68B

2024: $1.65B

2025: Company guiding $1.55-1.65B? Nah... more like $1.81B if they grow \~10% like previous years.. and here is why I think they will.

# McDonald's: Donut Sleep on This Partnership

DNUT rocketed last year on the news that they would start rolling out their product into McDonald's restaurants. So far, they are in 1,900 locations, but the CEO expects them to be in over 12,000 by the end of 2026. The math on these McDonuts is mind boggling. (Credit to White Brook Capital for pointing this out)

Price of a donut $1.60, McD commission 60% (total guess here but probably over estimating)

KK net rev per donut $0.64 (minus McDonald‚Äôs commission)

Average amount of McDonald's breakfast customers per day: 275 people

With an attach rate of 20%, \~55 donuts will be sold each day

Net rev per day $35.20, minus waste (donuts not sold) and delivery cost of $7 and $25 respectively= $3 net revenue a day which doesn‚Äôt seem like much until you take into account that that is $22 per week, $95 per month, $284 per quarter‚Ä¶ $1153 per year at each store.

**If we are looking at 12,000 McDonald's in 2 years‚Ä¶ that is $13,836,000 in profits each year from McDonalds alone.** And these are conservative estimates. Is your hole feeling glazed yet?! And imagine if they strike deals with other diabetes inducing restaurant chains!

Separately, Krispy Kreme donuts main points of access for consumers are at Target, Walmart, and grocery stores like Amazon/Safeway/Giant/Publix. I usually see these neat little stands when I walk in, and they are near the cash registers to ensure fatasses like myself buy them on an impulse.

# International Growth: Raking in the Dough

A big highlight from the recent earnings that I feel is being overlooked is that in the International segment, net revenue grew $7.4 million, or 5.7% and International organic revenue grew 7.8%. Why? Because the company is executing well in places like Japan and Germany, creating nearly 700 new point of access stores last year alone. I know from experience that Japanese people LOVE American food, they can't get enough of our KFC, cheeseburgers, and now apparently donuts. Their international growth also explains the company's 800m long term debt... but they need to spend to continue expanding and I think they are executing. The company expects leverage to trend towards 4.0x by year end 2025, which is not that concerning. Plus international markets are not effected by irrational fears of RFK Jr. somehow cracking down on donuts and junk food.

# Keep it simple and ""Old Fashioned""

In conclusion, don't over think this one. With a nearly 70% dip from yearly highs, ~~deez nuts~~ these donuts are on discount. This is a good, established product with a cult following and a dominating social media and online presence (over 1 billion impression last year). I have opened a small position that I will add more to overtime. I expect another small dip or two due to market volatility.

$DRI Bear Case,47,1jag9fl,https://i.redd.it/cr5rv96vihoe1.jpeg,29,2025-03-13 22:06:46,"Ticker: DRI (Darden Restaraunts Inc)

Price: ~$184

Restaurants Owned: Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Yard House, Ruth's Chris Steak House, Cheddar‚Äôs Scratch Kitchen, The Capital Grille, Chuy's, Seasons 52, Eddie V's, and Bahama Breeze

My Postions:
5x 1/16/26 $185 puts
5x 1/16/26 $170 puts

Bear Case: 

With the current economic instability and uncertainty, many stocks from all industries have seen sharp decreases in value. For the case of this write up, I will mostly be focused on hotel, restaurant, and airline industries, since these industries are closely correlated and are considered elastic goods. Moreover, tourism to the United States, which is a key revenue source for these industries, will likely be down going forward due to rises in foreign tensions. Many Canadians are already talking about cancelling and boycotting travel to the United States, so these industries will feel the repercussions in the following months/years.

Airlines: 
Delta: -30% in the past month
United Airlines: -28% in the past month
American Airlines: -30% in the past month

Restaurants/Food:
Sbux: -12.7% in the past month
Cava: -37% in the past month
Wingstop: -30% in the past month
Chipotle: -14% in the past month

Hotels:
Hyatt: -15.33% in the past month
Mariott: -15.4% in the past month
Hilton: -15.26% in the past month

$DRI has not yet taken a hit from the recent economic turmoil, only dropping 5% in the past month. Due to the target audience of its restaurants, I believe that they are more susceptible to the affects of a recession than fast food restaurants such as Wingstop, Chipotle, and Cava, which have seen significant dips recently. 

Restaurants like Olive Garden and Longhorse steakhouse are treated as a night out for lower class/lower middle class Americans, and will be among the first expenses to be cut when their budgets inevitably tighten. I believe in the case of a recession, more Americans will ditch restaurants like Olive Garden and Longhorse steakhouse than Chipotle, Wingstop, and Cava.

For reference here is how $DRI performed during the past recessions/pullbacks

2008: -68.5% decrease
2020: -63% decrease
2022: -25% decrease

I believe $DRI has much room to fall over the next year and maybe even longer.

High short interest indicates that a substantial number of investors are betting against a company‚Äôs stock, anticipating a price decline. Notable examples include:
	‚Ä¢	Enphase Energy (ENPH): This solar company has attracted significant bearish bets due to challenges from Chinese competition and high interest rates.  Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Super Micro Computer (SMCI): Known for its high short interest, indicating potential investor skepticism.  Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Albemarle (ALB): A lithium producer facing considerable short interest, possibly due to concerns over lithium market dynamics.  Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Fox Corporation (FOXA): The media company has seen increased short positions, suggesting bearish sentiment.  Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Moderna (MRNA): Despite its role in COVID-19 vaccine development, Moderna has experienced significant short interest, potentially due to uncertainties about future revenue streams.  Ôøº

2. Companies with Recent Earnings Misses:

Missing earnings expectations can lead to negative investor sentiment and potential stock price declines. Recent examples include:
	‚Ä¢	Crawford & Company B (CRD.B): Reported quarterly earnings of $0.19 per share, missing estimates of $0.24.  Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Vistra (VST): Reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.14 per share, significantly below the expected $2.17.  Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Deere & Company (DE): Reported a 30% decline in revenue and a 50% drop in net income for the first quarter of 2025 compared to the previous year.  Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Okta (OKTA): Released earnings that fell short of expectations by $0.48 per share.  Ôøº

3. Sector-Specific Challenges:

Certain sectors are facing headwinds that could impact stock performance:
	‚Ä¢	Semiconductor Industry: Companies like Nvidia (NVDA) have experienced recent corrections, and upcoming earnings reports from Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology (MRVL) could influence investor sentiment in the AI and semiconductor space.  Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Australian Energy Sector: Companies such as Boss Energy Ltd (BOE) and Paladin Energy Ltd (PDN) are among the most shorted ASX shares, indicating potential vulnerabilities.  Ôøº

Cautionary Note:

Investing based on short-term predictions carries inherent risks. It‚Äôs essential to conduct thorough research and consider consulting a financial advisor before making investment decisions.

# Background: Eli Lilly and the ‚Äúmiracle drug‚Äù GLP1¬†

Eli Lilly (LLY) is currently the world‚Äôs largest biotech/pharmaceutical company with a market cap of \~874B, largely due to its dominance in the rapidly growing GLP1 obesity drug market. The revenue of the entire GLP1 market is estimated to be \~44-55B, and the GLP1 market is expected to grow at a CAGR of \~15-30% for the next 5 years. LLY‚Äôs GLP1 business generated \~22B in GLP1 revenues in FY24, representing \~40-50% of total GLP1 market share (depends on estimates) and \~48% of LLY FY24 revenue. LLY GLP1 grew at an annualized rate of 60%, which management expects to continue into FY25. LLY currently trades at a trailing PE of \~77x and a forward PE of \~40x, with its relatively high valuation attributable to high expectations for its GLP1 business.¬†¬†

Of the \~250MM adults in the US, 40% or 100MM are obese, compared to 39% of the global adult population. Total GLP1 Total prescriptions in the US is estimated to be around 7.1MM adults, 2MM of which are for obesity. This represents 2% of obese US adults and even less internationally, and with LLY capturing \~57% of share, this signals massive opportunities for growth. According to recent surveys, 1 in 8 consumers have used GLP1 products, while 26% of US consumers expect to use GLP1 in 2025. Massive demand for GLP1 is apparent, and the main bottleneck for growth is LLY‚Äôs ability to meet demand. ¬†  
As a result, major investor focus is on LLY GLP1 manufacturing capabilities, which LLY has been heavily investing in.¬†

LLY Growth Challenges¬†

1. Supply Constraints ‚Äì supply cannot keep up with demand as there is not enough manufacturing capacity¬†
2. High Prices ‚Äì FDA approved GLP1 products are expensive, and most healthcare plans refuse to cover for obesity, customers unwilling to pay out of pocket¬†
3. Cheaper Alternatives ‚Äì supply constraints and high prices cause customers to seek compounded drugs as an alternative¬†
4. Aversion to injection ‚Äì current injectable format less attractive than oral drugs, dampening demand¬†

Competitive Landscape: LLY, NVO, and the Compounders¬†

Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk (NVO, the producer of Ozempic) are direct competitors in what is currently a two-player obesity drug market. However, due to the exceptionally high demand for GLP1 products, the combined supply from both companies has been insufficient in meeting demand, causing the FDA to declare both Tirzepatide and Semaglutide to be in shortage in 2022. This allowed for the compounding of GLP1 drugs under Section 503A and 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). Compounders consisting of both licensed physicians and outsourcing facilities could legally produce non-FDA approved versions of GLP1 drugs for both medical and commercial purposes, selling to customers at significantly cheaper prices compared to the patented, FDA-approved drugs of LLY and NVO. For example, Zepbound (LLY‚Äôs brand for obesity) costs $1000/month in 2024 while a compounded version could sell for as low as \~$45/month on HIMS. However, in October of 2024, the FDA removed Tirzepatide and Semaglutide from the shortage list after over two years, leading to the Outsourcing Facilities Association filing a suit against the FDA, and the case in currently pending.¬†

# LLY ‚Äì A Combination of Short-Term Catalysts¬†¬†

Major Catalysts Overview¬†

Here is an overview of the most important catalysts in the upcoming 1-2 months:¬†

1. OFA v. FDA preliminary injunction and case results (expected March-April, [here](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69232675/outsourcing-facilities-association-v-united-states-food-and-drug/?filed_after=&filed_before=&entry_gte=&entry_lte=&order_by=desc))¬†
2. Multiple Orforglipron (Orfor) Ph3 trial data (first expected in April, case [here](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05971940))¬†
3. Final US Government Budget Decision (deadline end of April, article [here](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2025-02-26/the-house-passed-a-budget-blueprint-what-happens-now))¬†
4. Pharmaceutical tariffs (25% and/or reciprocal, article [here](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/lilly-plans-invest-27-billion-new-us-plants-trump-threatens-pharmaceutical-2025-02-26/))¬†

While we highlight four potential catalysts, 3 and 4 are macro-level catalysts. We will focus primarily on Catalysts 1 and 2 (OFA v. FDA and Orfor Ph3 trial data), with our significant confidence (ahead of market consensus) in both catalysts being positive for LLY as the core of our long thesis. Both catalysts de-risk and pull strong growth levers for LLY.¬†

Additional Levers for Growth¬†

Beyond the Catalysts 1 and 2, we also briefly note additional tailwinds for LLY, though these are not the focus of our thesis:¬†

1. Growing supply capacity and continued investment in infrastructure and manufacturing (news release [here](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-plans-more-double-us-manufacturing-investment-2020))¬†
2. Pricing power with recent Zepbound and Mounjaro price cuts (news release [here](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-launches-additional-zepbound-vial-doses-and-offers-new))¬†
3. Increasing coverage for GLP1 by healthcare insurance (slowly, article [here](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/glp-1-drug-coverage-for-obesity-increasing/733596/))¬†

# Catalyst 1: OFA v. FDA¬†

The FDA took Tirzepatide off the drug shortage list, in October 2024 and February 2025, respectively. The Outsourcing Facilities Association (OFA) subsequently filed a lawsuit against the FDA. The core of plaintiff's \\case argues that FDA‚Äôs removal should be considered notice-and-comment ‚Äúrulemaking‚Äù under the APA, while the FDA argues that their actions fall under ‚Äúinformal adjudication‚Äù and does not require notice-and-comment. Judge Pittman has stated that he intends to rule this case as a ‚Äúmatter of law‚Äù; the case will be decided depending on whether he considers FDA‚Äôs removal of Tirzepatide from the shortage list as adjudication or rulemaking according to legal precedent and relevant cases brought forward by both sides. All relevant court documents that can be found [here](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69232675/outsourcing-facilities-association-v-united-states-food-and-drug/?filed_after=&filed_before=&entry_gte=&entry_lte=&order_by=desc). A very helpful podcast with biopharma lawyer Julia Cantu summarizing the situation can be found [here](https://www.martilawgroup.com/post/update-on-tirzepatide-compounding-the-fda-lawsuit-and-the-february-18th-deadline).¬†

GLP1 Compound Market Size¬†

To motivate why the OFA v. FDA case is significant for LLY, we project the potential revenue gain by estimating the current GLP1 compounding market.¬†¬†

One outsourcing facility, FarmaKeio (FK), has been selling roughly \~1.75-2 MM worth of Tirzepatide every month at \~$45/month. Hims and Hers (HIMS) reported 222 MM worth of revenue from compounding GLP1, also with prices around $45/month. With the total market for GLP1 estimated to be around 54 B in sales for 2024 and LLY and NVO representing \~42 B, the compounding market could represent \~12 B, or around 22% of the total GLP1 market. At the high end, up to 30% or \~16 B of GLP1 sales could be from compounders (according to [Beckers Hospital Review](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/glp-1s/30-of-glp-1-medications-acquired-via-compounding-pharmacies.html)).¬†¬†

Given that compound Tirzepatide is \~10-20x cheaper than brand Tirzepatide and the logical assumption that demand is relatively inelastic, we claim absolute GLP1 sales would not be significantly lower without compounding. Taking the baseline of no change in absolute sales and assuming LLY takes 60% share (based on current LLY/NVO market share), an end to compounding is a one-time \~20-30% boost to revenue, assuming LLY can meet demand.¬†

My Perspective on OFA v. FDA¬†

The result of this case lies purely in Judge Pittman‚Äôs interpretation of the FDA‚Äôs actions under the APA vis-√†-vi legal precedence, particularly the following cases presented in court submissions (which I have selected for relevance):¬†

* Safari Club Int‚Äôl v. Zinke, 878 F.3d 316, 333 (D.C. Cir. 2017)¬†
* United States v. Florida East Coast Ry. Co., 410 U.S. 224, 246 (1973)¬†
* Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass‚Äôn, 575 U.S. 92, 101 (2015)¬†
* McDonald v. Watt, 653 F.2d 1035, 1042 (5th Cir. 1981)¬†
* BNSF Ry. Co. v. Fed. R.R. Admin., 105 F.4th 691, 701 (5th Cir. 2024)¬†
* Little Sisters, 591 U.S. at 683‚Äì84, 685‚Äì86 (citing 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 553(b))¬†
* Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 221 (1988) (Scalia, J., concurring) (quoting Attorney General‚Äôs Manual on the APA 14 (1947))¬†
* City of Arlington, Tex. v. FCC, 668 F.3d 229, 243 (5th Cir. 2012)¬†
* Qwest Servs. Corp. v. FCC, 509 F.3d 531, 536‚Äì37 (D.C. Cir. 2007)¬†
* Am. Airlines, Inc. v. Dep‚Äôt of Transp., 202 F.3d 788, 796‚Äì97 (5th Cir. 2000)¬†

A quick meta-analysis shows that in administrative cases, conservative judges such as Judge Pittman tend to err on the side of allowing regulatory agencies to exercise their powers less striking legal transgressions. Intuitively, conservative judges would seek to intervene less in such disputes and refer to the experts and authorities; in this case, the FDA. Furthermore, closer scrutiny reveals Plaintiff‚Äôs argument centered on Safari Club ignores marked differences between the rulemaking of the US Fish and Wildlife Services (USFWS) and the delisting by the FDA.¬†¬†

In Safari Club, USFWS concluded that killing of elephants did not meet the ‚Äúenhancement requirement‚Äù under the existing Endangered Species Act (ESA), which stated that trophy hunting imports should be consistent with the conservation of the species. While the ‚Äúenhancement requirement‚Äù was understood as a critical requirement, there was no specific mandate in the ESA categorically banning trophy imports that do not provide a net benefit to the species. Therefore, it was the USFWS‚Äôs interpretation of the ESA that justified its policy to prohibit such imports and ban elephant trophy imports. This decision further involves the weighing of future conservation efforts because of trophy hunting, invoking a forward-looking, policy-oriented judgment as it weights future conservation efforts driven by future trophy hunting; prospective by nature and characteristic of rulemaking under the APA. Finally, the decision set a precedent for all future trophy imports, making it ‚Äúapplicable across the board‚Äù and ‚Äúgeneralized in nature‚Äù, consistent with the rulemaking definition under the APA. We conclude the ruling of the USFWS decision as rulemaking is consistent with the APA.¬†¬†

A comparison of the USFWS‚Äôs trophy import ban in Safari with the FDA‚Äôs delisting action then shows marked differences between the two, leading to the conclusion that the delisting action falls under informal adjudication. First and foremost, while USFWS made a prospective policy decision on future conservation and trophy hunting outcomes, and FDA‚Äôs decision is fundamentally a factual decision based on current supply and demand dynamics. There is no prospective aspect related to the decision; the FDA‚Äôs application of past data to existing drug shortage and compounding law to determine ‚Äúcurrent rights and liabilities‚Äù is more consistent with adjudication under the APA. Furthermore, while the USFWS decision set precedence and created new policy applicable to all future trophy imports, the FDA‚Äôs delisting directly alters current legal rights of compounders already outlined in existing legislation; no new, broad policy was created in the delisting process. Future drug shortages will still be determined by the FDA on a case-by-case basis. Again, this is consistent with adjudication under the APA.¬†¬†

The most intuitive argument is Perez vb. Mortg. Bankers Ass‚Äôn, 575 U.S. 92, 101 (2015), which states that the APA ‚Äúmandate\[s\] that agencies use the same procedures when they amend or repeal a rule as they used to issue the rule in the first instance‚Äù. Under the assumption that the delisting consisted of rulemaking, Perez guides that since the FDA did not engage in notice-and-comment when it listed Tirzepatide on the shortage list, it is not obligated to do so for the delisting.¬†¬†

The most convincing argument against Plaintiffs use of Safari Club is Vanda Pharms., Inc. v. FDA, 436 F. Supp. 3d 256, 270 n.4 (D.D.C. 2020), which rejected the argument that FDA‚Äôs analysis of scientific literature in an adjudication applied to future cases such that it was a legislative rule, and noting that, unlike in Safari Club, the agency‚Äôs analysis was ‚Äúin the context of adjudicating a particular set of disputed facts‚Äù. Essentially, Vanda established that determinations of shortage status fit under adjudication of disputed facts.¬†¬†

The other core part of Plaintiff‚Äôs arguments is how ‚Äú\[t\]he existence of a dispute concerning particular individuals is a distinguishing characteristic of adjudication.‚Äù McDonald v. Watt, 653 F.2d 1035, 1042 (5th Cir. 1981). The key here is whether Tirzepatide compounders in general can be classified as ‚Äúparticular individuals‚Äù. The FDA convincingly parries this argument using City of Arlington, Tex. v. FCC, 668 F.3d 229, 243 (5th Cir. 2012); Qwest Servs. Corp. v. FCC, 509 F.3d 531, 536‚Äì37 (D.C. Cir. 2007). The FDA argues that its delisting fits under a ‚Äúdeclaratory order‚Äù, a type of adjudication which ‚Äú\[has\] binding legal effect and allow agencies to efficiently apply existing policy to a set of facts without the need for any particular party to risk penalty or sanction to resolve a dispute‚Äù (FDA Opposition to PI, Case Doc 97, 2/20).¬†¬†¬†

Weighing all the submitted records and arguments, the ‚Äúsubstantial ink‚Äù the OFA has spilled ""arguing that FDA should have engaged in notice-and-comment rulemaking‚Äù (LLY Memo of Law in Opposition to PI Motion, Case Doc 89, 2/18) is exactly that ‚Äì the odds are strongly against the OFA. We conclude that not only is the motion for preliminary injunction will likely not be granted by Judge Pittman, a non-zero probability exists for the injunction to be moot entirely should the entire case be decided within the month of March, before the compounding deadline of March 19^(th) set by the FDA.¬†

Sensitivity Analysis for OFA v. FDA (LLY)¬†

Like the case itself, the implications for LLY depending on different ruling results are equally complex. To simplify, we designate two potential outcomes for LLY:¬†

1. Courts grant motion for PI. Whether FDA/LLY appeals, compounders have another \~6 months of legal compounding. We assign a \~20% probability to this scenario. Stock trades down \~0-3%, as the downside risk is the status quo, which we believe to be mostly priced into the stock (based on12/19 price action)¬†
2. Courts deny motion for PI, or the PI is moot and the Judge rules in favor of FDA/LLY. Deadline of March 19^(th) becomes the effective end date of all legal compounding as the case plays out. We assign a \~80% probability to this scenario. Stock trades up \~5-10%, based on our SOTP valuation of LLY below in which we attribute around \~75% of LLY market cap to its ex-Orfor GLP1 business, as well as our estimation of the GLP1 compounding market size to be \~20-30% of the total GLP1 market (below).¬†

We view OFA v. FDA risks as mostly to the upside. While LLY supply capacity is a key area of focus, any de-risking of uncertainty around compounding is likely to benefit LLY. Quantitatively, we estimate the market compounders are currently capturing that will largely move under LLY‚Äôs column under a positive ruling.¬†

# Catalyst 2: Orforglipron Phase 3 ACHIEVE-1 Data¬†

Orforglipron (Orfor) is an oral GLP1 agonist with potential to transform the diabetes and obesity market. Expected to reach market \~2 years before any competitor orals, LLY will enjoy significant first-to-market advantage and further dominant share if successful. Top-line data from multiple Phase 3 (Ph3) trials are expected this year for Orfor, beginning with ACHIEVE-1 in April, which focuses on Orfor for patients with Type-2 Diabetes (T2D) (study [here](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05971940#study-plan)). The key metrics to focus on for the study are the:¬†

1. Weight loss percentage: target of >7%, which implies weight loss for non-T2D obesity patients in the mid-teens, based on Tirzepatide T2D/Obesity comparison¬†
2. Discontinuation rate, specifically due to adverse effects (AEs): target of <10%¬†
3. HbA1C lowering profile (): target of >1.5%, which implies effectiveness in controlling blood sugar levels for T2D patients¬†

Table 1. Trial Results and Targets for Oral/Injectable GLP1s¬†

|| || |¬†|Weight Loss¬†¬†|Discontinuation Rate (due to AEs)¬†|HbA1C Lowering Profile¬†¬†|Weeks (Total, Titration)¬†| |Orfor Ph2 (T2D)¬†|8.2%¬†|15%¬†|1.8%¬†|26 (2-6 weeks)¬†| |Orfor Ph3 Targets (T2D)¬†|>7%¬†|<10%¬†|>1.5%¬†|40 (16 weeks)¬†| |Tirzepatide Ph2 (T2D)¬†|9.7%¬†|25%¬†|1.8%¬†|26 (2-6 weeks)¬†| |Tirzepatide Ph3 (T2D)¬†|9.1%¬†|7%¬†|2.0% (later trials up to 2.5%)¬†|40 (20 weeks)¬†| |Rybelsus Ph2 (NVO Oral)¬†|7%¬†|12%¬†|1.8-2%¬†|52 (26 weeks)¬†|

Most critical to Orfor Ph3 success is being able to outperform a weight loss percentage of 7% while maintaining a discontinuation rate lower than 10%. There is reason for investors to be confident in Orfor Ph3 data at least meeting expectations considering precedence with comparable Tirzepatide Ph2 and Ph3 trials. LLY management has indicated that increasing the titration period in Tirzepatide Ph3 trials helped reduce discontinuation rates from 25% to 7%; Orfor Ph3 sees a comparable increase in titration from 2-6 weeks to 16 weeks. Furthermore, strong HbA1C and weight loss percentages readings in Ph2 data has been a strong indicator of consistency in Ph3 trials as well; a 5% deviation from the Ph2 8.2% weight loss puts Ph3 well above our target of 7%.¬†¬†

Additional confidence can be found in LLY management stockpiling a ‚Äúpre-launch inventory‚Äù of over 550 MM worth of Orfor (article [here](https://www.tipranks.com/news/eli-lilly-lly-stockpiles-weight-loss-pill-ahead-of-regulatory-approval)) even before the first Ph3 trial data readout. The current stockpile would represent over 10 B in Orfor sales.¬†¬†

Sensitivity Analysis for Orfor Ph3 ACHIEVE-1¬†

Like the OFA v. FDA catalyst, the market reactions for Orfor Ph3 data in April will be complex and nuanced. To simplify, we model it with three most likely scenarios:¬†

1. Beating expectations. Weight loss >7%, HbA1C reduction >1.5%, and discontinuation rate due to AEs <10%. We assign a 70% probability to this case. Stock trades up \~5-10% as we shift to an Orfor bull-case in addition to de-risking.¬†
2. Meeting expectations. Weight loss \~5-6%, HbA1C reduction \~1-1.5%, and discontinuation rate due to AEs >10%. We assign a 20% probability to this case. Stock trades even at around \~0-3% due to de-risking of Orfor.¬†¬†
3. Missing expectations/failure. We assign a 10% probability to this case. Stock trades down \~5-10%.¬†

We assign stock movements for Orfor Ph3 based on our SOTP valuation for LLY below, in which we attribute around \~10% of LLY market cap to the Orfor pipeline.¬†

# LLY SOTP Valuation¬†

Table 2. LLY SOTP Valuation at $930/share implying an enterprise value of \~860B.¬†¬†

|| || |Business¬†|Enterprise Value¬†|Percentage of EV¬†|Equity Price/Share¬†| |Ex-Obesity/Diabetes¬†|170 B¬†|20%¬†|186¬†| |Orforglipron¬†|90 B¬†|10%¬†|93¬†| |GLP1 Ex-Orfor¬†|600 B¬†|70%¬†|651¬†| |Total¬†|860 B¬†|100%¬†|930¬†|

We break down LLY into three key segments for our SOTP valuation:¬†

1. Ex-obesity/diabetes. Excluding obesity and diabetes, LLY pipelines and drugs, such as Kisunla for early-stage Alzheimer's, are also promising. This segment represents around \~57% of FY24 revenue and around \~20% of the enterprise value.¬†¬†
2. GLP1 Ex-Orfor. Excluding Orfor, we price LLY to have \~60% of the total GLP1 market across biopharmaceutical companies.¬† OFA v. FDA is the main catalyst for this segment of the business, which can increase the total market by \~20-30%. A conservative projection of LLY capturing 60% share of a GLP1 compound market shrunk by \~50-75% due to price-demand elasticity gives between an \~8-15% increase in GLP1 Ex-Orfor segment valuation, reflecting a \~5-10% increase in share price on the conservative end.¬†¬†
3. Orfor segment. We estimate that the market currently prices Orfor at 90 B, which implies LLY capturing \~60% of the oral GLP1 market by 2033 with 12 B in Orfor sales at a probability of success (POS) of 70%. With a Ph3 de-risking of Orfor POS to around \~90%, Orfor segment valuation in the base-case increases by \~30% or around 27 B EV, reflecting a \~3% increase in share price. However, it also increases the probability of the bull case in which LLY captures upwards of 75% share in the oral GLP1 market, which would command at least a 175 B valuation assuming conservatively that total oral GLP1 market does not increase as well, adding 85 B EV, reflecting a \~10% increase in share price.¬†¬†

# Price Target ‚Äì Catalyst-Adjusted Valuation¬†¬†

Given significant confidence ahead of market consensus in both Catalyst 1 and 2 being positive for LLY, we use our SOTP and sensitivity analysis to drive our price target:¬†

1. Catalyst 1 gives \~5-10% share price increase at a POS of 80%, \~0-3% share price decreases at a POS of 20%, reflecting a probability weighted \~5.7% price increase.¬†
2. Catalyst 2 gives \~10% share price increase at a POS of 70%, a \~3% share price increase at a POS of 20%, and a \~10% share price decrease at a POS of 10%, reflecting a probability weighted \~6.6% price increase¬†

Combining these two catalysts, we derive a base-case upside of \~12.5% for LLY, with a bull-case upside of \~21%, reflecting a base-case PT of $1046 and a bull-case PT of $1135. We derive the bull case using a POS of 100% for both Catalyst 1 and 2.¬†

# Other Considerations¬†

Given the current regulatory environment and political landscape, it would be imprudent to not address sector and market risks impacting LLY. Fortunately for LLY, their business and sector are not at the center of any significant prospective tariffs, making biotechnology relatively attractive from a market-risk perspective. Healthcare and biotechnology have been traditionally defensive plays during times of uncertainty, reflected in LLY‚Äôs 0.47 beta despite its high valuation. A cursory comparison of the movements of LLY and the broader market in the past 1-2 weeks will demonstrate the low-beta nature of LLY. In fact, I believe a 0.47 beta overstates LLY‚Äôs exposure to market risks.¬†

The pharmaceutical tariff of 25% as the Trump administration has floated would certainly impact LLY. However, LLY is also investing significantly (50 B pledged) in domestic manufacturing, and North American currently represents \~73% of their total revenue. CEO David Ricks cites regulatory tailwinds, such as additional tax cuts on the 2017 Trump Tax Cut, as main motivators for the 50 B investment in the US. As a result, it is unclear whether the Trump administration will be a net benefit or detriment to LLY.¬†¬†

Lone Pine Capital¬†

As an interesting aside, Stephen Mandel‚Äôs Lone Pine Capital, a hedge fund with both a Long Only and Long/Short arm, added a new, sizable position in LLY in 4Q24 according to their 13F filing [here](https://13f.info/13f/000090266425001072-lone-pine-capital-llc-q4-2024), and more clearly visualized [here](https://hedgefollow.com/funds/Lone+Pine+Capital). A long position of 782k shares at an average price of 828/share representing a position of 604 MM and 4.5% of their total portfolio indicates confidence in the company.¬†

# Constructing the Trade¬†

Given our bullish stance on two significant catalysts in the upcoming \~1-2 months, we position ourselves long with slightly OTM May25 1000c calls at \~27 for maximum exposure to these catalysts. If we hold until expiry, the base-case PT of 1046 and the bull-case PT of 1135 represent a \~72% and \~405% return, respectively.¬†

# Introduction

Fellow regards, I‚Äôm sure we are all aware that the all Powell-ful Jerome will be determining, at the Fed meeting today, how hard a fucking our significant other‚Äôs boyfriend will be pumping out. Yet fewer have discussed what move they will be making based on this situation. My thesis is simple - the market has mispriced the chance of a rate cut, underestimating it, and so to take advantage of that, I have am in a long TLT position - a highly-leveragable, long-term government bond ETF. I‚Äôll first explain why I think there‚Äôs a higher chance of a rate slash than the market is telling us, specifically diving into why the market has been mispriced. I‚Äôll then move onto why this will cause TLT to rise, and also why I‚Äôve chosen TLT over other related assets.

# Why an interest rate cut seems likely to me

Let‚Äôs start with some basic economics. Modern monetary theory suggests that the FED uses interest rate hikes to lower inflation at the cost of weakening the economy (raising unemployment), while cuts strengthen the economy while causing inflation. Here's how our situation looks to me:

First, consider inflation. To be completely honest, I have been working on this thesis since before the release of CPI data for February - personally, I expected annual inflation, from January to February, to fall from 3% to 2.9%. So, I waited until March 10th for a bit of confirmation bias. I was greeted by:

[Fig 1.1. CPI for February 2025, all goods](https://preview.redd.it/hr2m6snl1npe1.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=30e0d3b370fff5664846a1fc00fcf019370518e0)

[Fig 1.2. 12-month inflation of February 2025, all goods](https://preview.redd.it/58duajjt1npe1.png?width=2464&format=png&auto=webp&s=7504887c1cdb54bb6655364ac732cd031b5fb310)

Inflation has retreated more than expected, falling to 2.8%. One of the many reasons why an interest rate cut initially seemed unlikely was  due to concerns of sticky inflation - this has provided evidence that inflation is falling. Granted, fed changes are not instant, and I‚Äôll address fears regarding inflation later on in more detail. However, this data has shown us that inflation isn't as bad as we thought it'd be, and seems to be falling - evidence in favour of a rate cut happening.¬†

On the other hand, the economy:

[Fig 2.1. Consumer sentiment data](https://preview.redd.it/j9khkay22npe1.png?width=1216&format=png&auto=webp&s=3844b51954a3e6f01801e10ba3334e014d3d6713)

Consumer sentiment has completely crashed, falling 10% from Febuary to March, with expectations showing an even bleaker result

[Fig 2.2. Consumer spending falls in January 2025](https://preview.redd.it/dp7hgvg82npe1.png?width=1222&format=png&auto=webp&s=abc1d6630a4380931629607fe431db721b62a781)

Actual spending has also fallen - for the first time in a long time, people are spending less, despite easing inflation. And while preliminary data has appeared for February showing consumer spending has gone back up by 0.2%, this is still underperforming expectations. A weak consumer base, unwilling to spend, is never a good sign.

[Fig 2.3. ISM Manufacturing¬†- PMI Index](https://preview.redd.it/cwzyk03j2npe1.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0197772d801cd7f15e9f317e79c0199b0fb163d)

[Fig 2.4. A more detailed look at the index](https://preview.redd.it/eg6p861q2npe1.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=9137514ca9dc0db417be1cd38bf9252c809451a0)

The manufacturing index has also seen better days. The manufacturing PMI has fallen from 50.9 to 50.3 in February. Now, in all fairness, this still means there is growth - any score above 50 indicates expansion - however, it means that growth is slowing down and seems to be at an inflection point, where it‚Äôll start contracting again. Looking at the specifics, we also see details that show new orders and employment numbers are contracting, production and exports are seeing reduced growth, all while imports are growing at an accelerated pace. None of these show the signs of a confident economy. But perhaps most important to us degenerates, the stock market worries:

[Fig 2.5. Trillions wiped off the stock market in the last 2 weeks](https://preview.redd.it/0mndpd1v2npe1.png?width=1202&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0a513492d726a76f2b3c57b054ac238b7e89f8f)

I‚Äôm sure all of us remember last week, when our portfolios got bent over by trump refusing to rule out a recession. A recession. I don‚Äôt think it can be spelled out any clearer to even the passengers of the shortest of buses - Trump does not seem to mind, and in fact is open accepting of recession

[Fig 2.6. Google searches for recession surging](https://preview.redd.it/5xev3p0w3npe1.png?width=2338&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3f642682041e45ebcd926105b0be2647892d509)

Another decent indicator of recession is also the number of google searches you see for it - clearly, we're amidst another breakout.

[Fig 2.7. Holy fucking shit](https://preview.redd.it/v6p7emz44npe1.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea9eae8a32a16633f308444716a58e680b97de93)

The long and short of it is that it‚Äôs not looking good. Crashing consumer expectations, cratering stock prices, manufacturing slowdowns - they all paint the picture of a recession coming up. Thus, with inflation not too bad, I believe that the FED should prioritise bringing back economic growth over keeping inflation down.

# A mispricing in the market

So, given the sorry state of our economy and comparatively better inflation control, you'd expect the market to price the chance of an interest rate cut at 40%, maybe 20%, maybe very low end, 5%. In reality...

1 per cent

According to a popular betting market, there is just a 1% chance Powell will change the interest rate today. Now of course, the betting market does not automatically correspond to what the stock market is thinking - however, any investor that sees an obvious arbitrage opportunity like this would be able to make a 100-fold return against tens of millions of dollars of liquidity if the stock market disagreed, so it seems to me that this accurately reflects the general sentiment.

Here's the most important part of my DD that I want to emphasise. In fact, if there‚Äôs any takeaway from my DD, let it be this:

I am **not** telling you Jerome will definitely cut rates tomorrow. In fact, anyone claiming to know for sure what Jerome will do tomorrow either has inside information, is lying, or is grossly misinformed. The first group will never talk to the likes of us, the second group is taking advantage of the likes of us, and the third group belongs among the likes of us.¬†

No, all my DD hinges upon is the idea that the chance of an interest rate cut is higher than 1%. That‚Äôs all you need - the thought that interest rate cuts aren't being priced in correctly, and that‚Äôs where any real money is made - mispricings in the market. I personally don‚Äôt see how the chance of an interest rate cut is not higher than 5% - if your takeaway from my analysis is that it will be anything above 1%, you too believe, there is a mispricing in the market, and can profit from purchasing TLT.¬†

So this begs the question of why there's a market mispricing

# Why is there a mispricing / ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre forgetting about‚Ä¶‚Äù

There are a couple ideas that people can bring up to suggest why interest rate cuts are unlikely - I‚Äôll try and cover the main ones and deliver a rebuttal on all of them.

Firstly, there‚Äôs concern of inflation from Trump‚Äôs tariffs. This is not unfounded - tariffs are inflationary, and perhaps the worry of inflation is too great to cut rates. Firstly, I‚Äôd like to point out that many of Trump‚Äôs other policies are deflationary: deregulation and government spending cuts are both deflationary, and I don‚Äôt think we truly realise how likely ‚Äútail-end events‚Äù like cutting half of military spending is with an unpredictable guy like Trump - he‚Äôs discussed it before. Secondly, Jerome Powell himself has stated, at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business on March 7th, that tariffs may cause a one off price hike, but that ‚Äúlonger-term expectations remain stable and consistent with our 2% inflation goal‚Äù. A one-off rise in inflation will not need to be adjusted for - as Powell correctly ascertains, policies should only deal with persistent inflation.

Secondly, some will mention that Powell himself has said before that it is not in a hurry to cut interest rates. I will point out that these quotes are all from before March 10th, before Trump refused to rule out the chance of a recession, before the stock market plummeted and lost trillions of dollars, and before we saw consumer confidence sour so drastically. The situation has changed, and Powell is now much more likely to slash rates.

Finally, the previous point already alludes to this, but one idea is that there‚Äôs a conflict between Trump and Powell, in the way that Trump is almost trying to cause economic panic to force Powell into lowering interest rates. People will have you believe that big J, in an attempt to win this dick-swinging contest, will refuse to back down and keep interest rates constant. Maybe, maybe, but what's more important than winning the measuring contest is preventing the ruin that will come to millions if we fail to cushion economic downturn. Jerome does not want to be the guy who failed to do enough and saw America go through a recession or worse. In fact, I‚Äôll go so far as to say the opposite - I think Powell is likely to fold now due to his past expereince. Many criticisms have been levelled against the man on account of the fact that he didn‚Äôt hike rates early enough in 2021, which led to out-of-control inflation. I think that it‚Äôs likely that he has learned from this mistake, and I‚Äôd err on him acting sooner rather than later on cutting rates.

Most important to keep in mind however, is that maybe you still have doubts about if Jerome is likely to cut interest rates. Keep in mind - we‚Äôre not asking if it‚Äôs more likely he‚Äôll cut rates or keep them the same. We‚Äôre asking if the market is mispriced - if the chance he‚Äôll cut rates is higher than 1%. Any bit of edge is a bullish indication for TLT.

# Ok, I think the chance of a cut is higher than 1%. How do I make money off that

Minimising risk. It's arguably the one of the core tenets of the stock market - the idea of a net worth rising in a safe and predictable straight line is tantalising to all but the most degenerate regard. It's why so many rich people are willing to take a below-market return from a hedge fund - there's a team of brilliant Asian quants out there who, instead of curing cancer or perfecting interplanetary travel, are creating the most ridiculous and incomprehensible financial products to tame risky and volatile assets into neat little beta neutral, uncorrelated returns that beat the risk free rate by half a percent, all for the price of a 2/20 fee structure. There's money to be made in lowering risk.

However, you‚Äôre in the wrong subreddit if you‚Äôre that brilliant Asian quant. As such, we‚Äôll be doing the opposite - taking the safest investment in the world - US treasury bonds, and jacking it up to the tits in leverage to increase risk, in return for enlarged profits.

Firstly, treasury bonds are the asset of choice because I think that they will have the largest quick movement due to this mispricing in the market. Stock markets react unpredictably to interest rate movements - bonds do not. For those who don‚Äôt know, when interest rates fall, all new government bonds issued have lower coupon rates. As such, the old government bonds, with comparatively higher coupon rates, rise in value. This is why ‚Äúgovernment bonds rise in value when rates are cut, and vice versa‚Äù. This is even more so for long-term treasury bonds compared to short-term bills - since the coupon is paid out many more times, the rise in value is exaggerated too.

The liquid variety for long-term treasury bonds is the TLT, an ETF that tracks the bond price. Not only is the liquidity a plus, but the asset being an ETF allows you to buy options on it, letting you purchase different calls until you are sufficiently leveraged for your personal risk tolerance.

Unfortunately, I‚Äôm a broke ass college student who has an evil, satanic, institutional broker that doesn't allow me to buy options. So, I‚Äôve spent about half my money on TLT shares.¬†

# What Next

Now, of course, I don‚Äôt know for sure if Jerome will cut rates. Here are my rough plans based on what happens next:

1. Rates get cut:

I‚Äôd expect TLT to rise sharply, due to the market not expecting this cut. Happy days. Probably sell and throw the money into a global fund, or maybe hold onto the position, anticipating more cuts throughout the year.

2. Rates don‚Äôt move:

Then in this case, TLT probably won‚Äôt move significantly, since the market is pretty much expecting this outcome. I‚Äôd probably hold onto my position a bit longer, since if he‚Äôs not cutting now, he needs to cut by May. This would also probably give me a generally bearish attitude on the US economy and stocks - I think this would be cutting rates a little too late. Probably start throwing more of my money into bonds and international markets.

Either way, I think that this mispricing in the market can be capitalised on. Good luck regards!

tl;dr - Due to a weak economy, I think there‚Äôs a higher than 1% chance rates will be cut (the market prediction), therefore, the markets have priced TLT too low"

**The FUD: ‚Äòdata center oversupply‚Äô**

Headlines have been coming out that Microsoft walking away from a ‚Äúcouple hundred MWs‚Äù of datacenter leases (note, this would likely represent <5% of their overall estimated 5 GW installed capacity). Analysts are also insinuating this means there is a larger ‚Äòoversupply‚Äô and therefore AI capital expenditures will be slowing down.

[The Register - Microsoft's drawback on datacenter investment may signal AI demand concerns](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=newssearch&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwj8jtzHg9-LAxXol-4BHfCRJ4cQxfQBKAB6BAgPEAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theregister.com%2F2025%2F02%2F24%2Fdoes_microsoft_pull_back_on%2F&usg=AOvVaw3nXfbntonLATxN5KnPWAzG&opi=89978449)

*‚ÄúTD Investment bank claims software giant ditched 'at least' 5 land parcels due to potential 'oversupply'‚Äù*

¬†

**The Critique: Dip Buying Opp?**

First off, it is not clear if these MSFT leases are for high-performance compute (GPUs for AI workloads) or traditional non-AI cloud (for things like storage, where demand has been waning). For the sake of argument, let‚Äôs assume this was for AI compute.

**Point 1** \- Overall, Microsoft is not slowing down. After the TD report on Friday, Microsoft [reiterated they are not cutting their $80bil capital spending plan for this year](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/microsoft-reiterates-plan-to-invest-80-billion-in-ai-.html). So, as they are walking away from a couple hundred MWs of leased capacity, meanwhile they will be building several GWs.

**Point 2** \- In Q4, Microsoft missed cloud revenue targets. On the earnings call, CFO Amy hood noted shortfalls in Q4 performance was due to supply constraints, and the larger capex spend is expected to drive stronger Azure growth. In other words, the revenue miss was a *capacity problem*, not a *demand problem*. So why slow down now? Doesn‚Äôt add up.

**Point 3** ‚Äì Open AI is adding more compute capacity with other partners (Oracle and Softbank). This would represent a ***shift*** in capital spending from Microsoft to others, i.e. this does not indicate an oversupply.

[Microsoft and OpenAI evolve partnership to drive the next phase of AI - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/01/21/microsoft-and-openai-evolve-partnership-to-drive-the-next-phase-of-ai/)

‚ÄúMicrosoft has **approved OpenAI‚Äôs ability to build additional capacity**, primarily for research and training of models.‚Äù

‚Äú**Microsoft is largely left on the sidelines as OpenAI utilizes another infrastructure partner.** As Satya Nadella¬†[stated](https://x.com/ns123abc/status/1882085592135237737?s=19), ‚Äúall I know is, I‚Äôm good for my $80B.‚Äù Microsoft‚Äôs recent¬†[blog post](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/01/21/microsoft-and-openai-evolve-partnership-to-drive-the-next-phase-of-ai/)¬†stated the facts of the partnership and how Microsoft has a ROFR, but the reality is this is¬†incrementally negative for¬†Microsoft long-term since they were **afraid to take on the risk of this investment.**¬†‚Äú

‚Äú**Microsoft is shifting some of the capital intensity of its AI initiatives on to Oracle**, but we don‚Äôt think this short-term benefit outweighs the long-run potential harm of losing the revenue and control over OpenAI.‚Äù

**AI continues advancements:**

Anthropic‚Äôs [Claude 3.7](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/anthropics-claude-3-7-sonnet-the-first-hybrid-reasoning-model-is-now-available-in-amazon-bedrock/) was released Monday and is quickly approaching professional human-level coding abilities (70% on SWE bench, which measures agentic coding ability vs. 80% avg. score for a human professional). Open AI‚Äôs ChatGPT 4.5 is rumored to be released in the coming weeks as well. These are/will be tangible results in the advancement of these models towards agentic use with addressable markets in the trillions (think remote ‚Äòdrop-in‚Äô AI coworker). Further, continued investment in U.S. AI infrastructure will be of paramount importance to national security (maintaining AI supremacy over China). ¬†

**TLDR:** I see this as a dip buying opportunity on AI names & energy. Overreaction from MSFT news. (NVDA, TSM, VRT\*\*, AVGO, MRVL, ANET, CIEN, NBIS, APLD, VST, OKLO, ET, KMI)

No chatgpt and I am highly regarded. 

**First point: reverse head and shoulders**

A. initial low post ipo slide @$11.68

B. one higher low in late 2023 @$15.12

C. ATL early 2024 @$8.26

D. Higher low late 2024 @$9.50

In these 4 points(circled in graph), is developing, somewhat of a reverse head and shoulders pattern, I believe there might be opportunity for breakout, especially after the recent market wide selloff driving higher risk stocks like RIVN down sharply. Confirmation would be around $15-16 and I believe this could bring it to the $20-35 range

**Second point: Descending triangle Sellers meeting buyers floor**

As seen in the chart, there is a clear series of lower highs(blue downward sloping line), and support from buyers around $11. The price has been flirting with the upward trend line, and I believe there are two scenarios. 

1. The stocks goes sharply lower, driven by broader market forces, marking it‚Äôs capitulation and goes sharply higher from abysmal lows. 

2. Market trades sideways or upwards and RIVN starts an upward trend more gradually

Either way, I see an opportunity in trading this stock. With it losing $5.3B last year, I can‚Äôt convince myself to invest in it as a long term value play (my normal investments), but I can see it as an acquisition target from a bigger auto player or PE (private equity) fund who wants to get skin in the EV game, either of these two giving an insane valuation justification for short term trading. 

I wouldn‚Äôt be so confident in this if it weren‚Äôt for the, I guess I‚Äôll call it, among other things.. ‚ÄúEV biased administration‚Äù and it‚Äôs partnership with players like Amazon and VW. 

I‚Äôm a buyer in the $7.75 - $9.50 range. Might buy some today just to get some skin in the game as I don‚Äôt hate it at $11.35, just don‚Äôt love it. 

Also, I think it‚Äôs important to note, I‚Äôm cautionary with options on this play, especially deep OTM Calls that will be worthless if an acquisition price is less than strike after a 30-40% pop from rumors of M&A (merger and acquisition).

**TL;DR** If Europe continues to be serious about cutting ties with the USA, cloud computing will shift towards domestic options. There are only two clear publicly-traded choices, IOS and OVH. Many private companies also exist in this sector, but if there is a race for the EU everyone probably wins enough not to care.

Long time lurker, first time poster. Glad for any constructive feedback and discussion. This is some fresh thinking so I expect there are serious holes in the logic, and there are definitely other sectors to consider.

Those of you tuned into the EU/USA relationship may have noted things are a bit interesting at the moment. For the past few years RHM would jump on any escalation of the Ukraine war, but after the latest American presidential inauguration basically every defense-related stock in Europe is going vertical. Some tickers and their change since January 20:

* BAE Systems (BA) +30%
* Leonardo (LDO) +80%
* Thales (HO) +45%

* Hensoldt (HAG) +90%

But that is not the topic for today.

Today we look into the future and see that Europe will realize that its entire compute infrastructure is essentially developed, owned, and operated by American companies. While the tech companies are not nationalized by the American government, the fact that reclusive billionaires who were mostly out of the game are coming back to assert that they will play ball (Sergey Brin calling for 60-hour work weeks...) suggests that something is going on in the background. People will become increasingly concerned about the potential for a widescale cyberattack comparable to Stuxnet, except that the target is the entire European economy rather than Iranian nuclear facilities.

So what can Europe and the EU do, apart from nothing?

First, there is the option to reinforce existing legislation regarding privacy and security of data. The EU already effectively operates as a second Internet due to GDPR, which results in data processing happening in specific geographic regions (i.e. not USA) and users being allowed to refuse to certain types of data processing (e.g. cookie banners). As a consequence, cloud providers have options for noting exactly where data be stored, processed, or transmitted. That said, many US websites are simply not available in the EU due to a lack of desire to attempt to comply, including many news sites and certain home improvement stores. Adding new legislation could look something like ensuring that the compute infrastructure must be audited, that staff must be EU nationals, or something else which enables oversight on the supply chain a la the existing guidance [\[2\]](https://www.edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/publications/guidelines/guidelines-use-cloud-computing-services-european_en). I expect something to happen in this space, but mostly reactive and definitely too late.

Second, USA companies can fork their operations and sell off European assets to these new European entities. This would be a fairly disruptive shift given that the workers in different regions can have dramatically different skillsets and pay grades. For example, tech giants like Google would have to give up access to their cheap labor in Europe, where wages are typically not more than half of the Silicon Valley standard [\[3\]](https://www.levels.fyi/companies/google/salaries/software-engineer/locations/berlin-metropolitan-region?dma=10025). This can be a motivating factor for the push towards automation of knowledge work as a whole: just as outsourcing software development from EU to Ukraine was disrupted by the war, so too would be American outsourcing to Europe if the US-Russia/EU conflict escalates.

Third, EU companies (and elsewhere) can choose to move off of AWS, Azure, and GCP onto EU equivalents. Which brings us to the point: what are the European cloud computing companies that we can invest in?

If we dig through the database of European alternatives for cloud computing [\[4\]](https://european-alternatives.eu/category/cloud-computing-platforms), things are a bit dire. After all, Europe basically did not develop a real software infrastructure and barely has an understanding of the associated mindset, so most of these services seem to be technically sound but small. Plus, many companies (e.g. Hetzner) are built in the German Mittelstand style of close private ownership and thus we have no easy access for investment.

If we are to look at an ideal option for investment we should consider the following:

* The first movers will likely be security- and stability-minded because that is what motivates them to be proactive. They are likely to put up with rough edges in the short term in exchange for the bare-metal ownership, and thus will likely target companies with resilient hosting of both compute and data (e.g. automatic replication in distinct geographies). I expect many firms in defense and finance are already considering or have already implemented these plans.
* The big wave of movers will likely focus on reactive migration of existing services. They may have considered migrating but have not executed on it out of either caution, a lack of initiative, or simply a last of a sense of urgency. Some large event will scare them into action and thus their priority will be on wholesale rapid migration of their existing systems to the EU, as quickly as possible and essentially without consideration of cost. The winner here will either be the big firm which everyone knows is not wrong (does not yet exist) or the one with the smoothest sales onboarding and experience. Think back to uptake of Zoom during the pandemic versus all of the also-rans (Blue Jeans, Jitsi, GoToMeeting, Skype, Teams, Google Meet, Cisco...). If you are sitting there panicked by the scope of the work but are greeted with a friendly and reassuring interface, you can make it work and you will not care about the price tag. So, a good migration user experience will triumph over a good developer experience in the mid term. During this period, price gouging may happen but likely will be monitored by the EU to some extent.
* After that wave of migration, developers may start to complain enough that the developer experience becomes important, and the European frugality will drive prices down. This phase is more about the 5-year picture and may be disrupted by the sheer volume of people on the platform that won in the short term.
* Finally, hardware supply chains will come under scrutiny but in general it will be decided that it is too expensive to rip out existing systems except in the most clearly critical systems. This is probably a mistake from a security perspective but the line has to be drawn somewhere. That said, if companies like Visa or Mastercard come under scrutiny and get kicked out of Europe then all bets are off.

Catalysts to consider:

* Everyone finally decides to act on the fact that the USA has already de facto decided to leave NATO and the UN, leading to increased pro-European action
* A cyberattack against European or American infrastructure occurs, leading to sanctions
* China invades Taiwan, threatening the hardware supply chain
* USA withdraws troops from some or all of its territories in Europe, threatening the USD
* Russia invades a NATO country, possibly one of the Baltics

So we are looking for companies with as close to a 1-to-1 mapping of existing cloud features as possible, which are already established across Europe, and which have a good interface for migration from other platforms. Digging through a list of European alternatives [\[4\]](https://european-alternatives.eu/category/cloud-computing-platforms) we find exactly two publicly traded options: Ionos (IOS) and OVH Group S.A. (OVH). I also looked at Aruba S.p.A., Cyso Hosting BV, Elastx, Exoscale (owned by A1), gridscale GmbH (owned by OVHcloud), Hetzner Online GmbH, Open Telekom Cloud (owned by T-Systems International GmbH), Seeweb s.r.l., and STACKIT GmbH & Co. KG, but all of these are private and most are small.

This as a searing indictment of the European software scene and of the public markets here as a whole.

https://preview.redd.it/1331yfk9zime1.png?width=2054&format=png&auto=webp&s=275ff950f6a61851862761d0587592e8720f8c25

First up, **Ionos Group SE (IOS)**, market cap 3.5B. They had 1.5B in revenue in 2024 (10% annual growth) with 4100 employees. These guys went public in 2023-02 and are up about 60% since then. Their website is slick enough and hides the dirty details that might scare the casual browser (APIs, SDKs, and related developer documentation). Migration services do seem to exist. At the surface this seems like the people I would try to at minimum get a solid sales call with.

https://preview.redd.it/xamaygmazime1.png?width=2019&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fd0acae30fe6463df281e7884eb94f5da178c1a

Second, **OVHcloud (OVH)**, market cap 1.8B. They had 1.2B in revenue in 2024 with 2900 employees. You may know them from the fire they had a few years back [\[5\]](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/ovhcloud-fire-france-data-center/). They have a good range of services but it is not clear that cloud migration is one of them. Stock performance is not great (down 70% since the start of 2022) but we're looking for value here and it seems that they have only just become profitable this past year (see [\[6\]](https://corporate.ovhcloud.com/sites/default/files/2025-01/ovhcloud-2024.11-plaquette-vdef-eng.pdf) and [\[7\]](https://corporate.ovhcloud.com/sites/default/files/2023-11/2023.08_-_ovh_groupe_-_plaquette_-_eng_-_vdef.pdf)). As a potential customer I would talk with this team but it would feel a bit uphill to get through to the migration specialists.

So, where to go from here? I took a small position in both IOS and OVH to get a bit of skin in the game. Both seem to be profitable companies with reasonable growth trajectories. The next phase of DD will be to do a bit of networking and see where sentiment is pushing. If this goes the same way as the defense sector I expect that all cloud companies will see a sharp uptick in sales and valuation, so I would balance holdings across the sector for now rather than picking a winner. Though calling two public companies a ""sector"" is a bit generous.

If the sovereignty logic seems sound to you, then consider analysis of the following sectors:

* Financial infrastructure. Mastercard is already on the radar of the European Commission [\[8\]](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_19_582), and a pro-Europe movement could see Visa and Mastercard as threats
* Computing hardware. While Europe is home to ASML, hardware design firms and fabrication facilities are not as prominent, though places like imec do exist. There is already precedent for additional spending here [\[9\]](https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/growth/items/46654/) and TSMC is building a facility in Dresden, Germany [\[10\]](https://pr.tsmc.com/english/news/3169)
* Intelligence. Where is the European Palantir?
* Petrochemicals. An escalation of conflict with the USA could interrupt trade and result in Europe looking to Norway or Saudi Arabia to improve access.

Cannabis was a shit trade over the last 4 years. Anyone who touched the sector was immediately sent to baggy land. The $MJUS ETF got delisted, market caps down 90%+, the AUMs of cannabis funds sliding to zero, there's zero investor confidence.

Look at that shit stain of a chart.

Guh

Anyone around in 2021 was familiar with the cannabis bull run. Stinky stoner teens in their moms' basements tossing their stimmy checks at shit like Tilray. It was all garbage. Everyone knew it, but the bet was federal legalization would bake in all the hype valuation.

After ü•≠left in 2020, weed bulls were hype for ‚ôø. Biden hit the office in 2021 and made it clear he didn't care about federal legalization. Efforts in congress grinded to a halt. Momentum faded and so did the share price.

Wishful thinking slapped the hand of dipshit trendfollowing retail yet again (I see you, $PLTR baggy!), and has seriously punished anyone holding cannabis over the last 4 years.

But of course, where there's enough blood in the water, you buy.

$CNBS is basically the last way to get broad exposure to US weed stocks now. All the other ETFs died. Here's what they hold.

And honestly, the valuations on these companies look **really fucking attractive** now.

Let's crack open Green Thumb, 1.6B market cap.

https://preview.redd.it/ssem3fzvbsme1.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=77242229227d439e25bd3e6eb3f2a92c1c5a9d6a

Share price down 90%+ has led to the company trading for \~7x operating income.

You also get $711M of tangible book value. That's basically half the market cap.

Of course, management for all these cannabis stocks were busy smoking the product in 2020-2022 and decided to acquire a bunch of shit for way more than they should have. This has inflated their goodwill on the balance sheet substantially, but their return on tangible assets is actually really good.

You can calculate the Buffett Return (similar to ROIC/ROA) to get an idea of how they are pushing income on their assets:

**Buffett-style Return Calculation:**

* Buffett-style Return = Owner Earnings / (Inventory + PP&E)
* Buffett-style Return = $245,012,000 / $550,163,000
* Buffett-style Return ‚âà 0.445 or 44.5%

Green Thumb looks super attractive **at today's sales and revenue, assuming ZERO growth.**  Their return is quite high, you're getting the business with substantial tangible book value, and at a single digit multiple to operating income. What else could you ask for?

That is the recurring thesis you will see with these holdings, that pessimism has peaked to the point that **weed could never be federally legal, no future states could choose to legalize, and the valuations here still make sense.**

Let's move to holding #2 Trulieve

https://preview.redd.it/mryat9i7fsme1.png?width=832&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f3e16d1016893fbee1989aea72d2811d36ccdd4

Stinky EBITDA after taxes.

What sucks about this industry is that the tax bills are massive. They're against the revenue and not the operating income of the business, so there's no real way to avoid them. They're also really, really high. But, it doesn't make Trulieve uninvestible.

At 775M market cap, Trulieve has 487M in tangible book value, about 2/3 of the market cap. That's a wild margin of safety. COGS and OPEX are also decreasing significantly. It looks like their gross margins are substantially increasing though. The stock looks pretty cheap at \~4X EBITDA. Even if we use their shitty EBITDA-Taxes, they're trading at \~7x the 3 year average.

Finally, I want to look at Curaleaf.

https://preview.redd.it/by7x70h2jsme1.png?width=826&format=png&auto=webp&s=4342887167ea0fa5d5d1ba792459fae65266c375

Beautiful profitability and steady with the revenue while increasing their margins. Always great to see.

At 780M market cap, Curaleaf actually has negative tangible book value of 800M. But you're paying 780M market cap for an amazing reason. The company is trading for about 4X cash flow, easily the best value proposition on an income multiple.

**My position:**

I am currently holding 500 shares long of $CNBS for around $10,000.

https://preview.redd.it/pny1ljdejsme1.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e21b417618d101699f7deb0d64d276a5c5bc52

I believe the tariff talk has caught these stocks in an unintentional crossfire considering the close Canadian ties. Obviously the chart technicals don't help.

Honestly, I'm bias towards buying deep value situations under deep investor pessimism. It's [how I made my bags on $BABA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h55bbd/china_bad_baba_good_dd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) which is up over 50% in the past 3 months since posting. These situations where investor emotions are clouding business fundamentals are my bread and butter, and hopefully some people here see the value as well.

I'm comfortable holding a relatively small position in Cannabis. If we don't get legalization, these bets are placed at fair value for their current operations. If we do get legalization in more states, or federal legalization, you know exactly what these stocks are doing. Up, up, up, but downside here is very muted. Asymmetrical risk at its finest.

TL;DR: Buy weed stocks, they're cheap, sentiment is horrible, can't really get worse from here. $CNBS"

Can Newly Released NVIDIA Dynamo Open Source Reasoning Software Save NVIDIA's Stock?,32,1jed83g,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jed83g/can_newly_released_nvidia_dynamo_open_source/,30,2025-03-19 00:46:09,"First we need to know what the NVIDIA Dynamo Open Source Reasoning Software is for.



The above description comprehensively summarizes the main functions and application scenarios of NVIDIA Dynamo, as well as the revolutionary impact it may have on AI inference and its long-term positive effect on the company‚Äôs stock price. Specifically:



Software Functions and Application Scenarios



Intelligent Scheduling and Resource Allocation: Dynamo not only inherits the advantages of the NVIDIA Triton Inference Server but also goes further by dynamically allocating GPU resources to cope with fluctuating inference request volumes, ensuring that each GPU operates at high efficiency even under heavy load.

Optimizing Large Language Model Inference: It adopts a decomposed service strategy, distributing the processing and generation stages of large language models across multiple GPUs, which significantly improves throughput in practical applications. For example, when running the DeepSeek-R1 model on certain rack clusters, the number of tokens generated per GPU can be increased by approximately 30 times.

Multi-Framework Support and Expanded Use Cases: As an open-source software, Dynamo can support various frameworks including PyTorch and NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM, making it suitable for cloud service providers, data centers, and enterprise AI factories.

Revolutionary Significance



Innovation in Resource Utilization: By leveraging intelligent routing and dynamic allocation, Dynamo can double performance and revenue with the same hardware resources, fundamentally changing traditional inference deployment methods.

Building an Open-Source Ecosystem: Its open-source nature not only promotes standardization and innovation in distributed inference architectures but also fosters collaborative progress across the entire AI industry.

Enhancing Cost Efficiency and Performance: By reducing data transmission and storage costs as well as increasing GPU computational density, the software is expected to make AI services more efficient and cost-competitive.

Potential Impact on NVIDIA‚Äôs Stock Price In the long term, Dynamo is expected to help consolidate NVIDIA‚Äôs leadership in AI infrastructure, especially as the data center and cloud services segments continue to expand, thereby driving higher revenue and profit growth for the company. Although the market might remain cautious about the immediate results of the new product launch in the short term, the widespread adoption of this technology by more service providers is anticipated to have a positive effect on the stock price.



Why do I think NVIDIA Dynamo Open-Source Inference Software will have a positive impact on NVDA's stock price?

Because this software will substantially boost NVIDIA's revenue in data center and cloud services.



From the public earnings data and market expectations, NVIDIA's data center and cloud services business has shown an upward trend in recent years, but it should be noted that the proportion here is subject to quarterly fluctuations, especially in quarters driven by AI demand (e.g., in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, data center revenue once accounted for 90.5%)

[CN.INVESTING.COM](http://CN.INVESTING.COM)

), while the full-year average is much smoother. Estimates based on current public information and analysis:



FY2023: Data center and cloud services business will account for approximately 43% of total annual revenue.

FY2024: The market expects this to rise to around 50% or so, driven by continued strong AI demand.

FY2025: While some quarters (e.g. Q4) are particularly strong, on average for the year, the share of data center and cloud services is expected to stabilize between 50% and 55%.

**TLDR**: Innovative biotech company that is currently ramping up sales of its new innovative medicine, which is the new standard of care in sickle cell disease. Large pipeline may lead to 50X growth from here according to CEO‚Äôs lofty goals. Several catalysts are expected in April/May and June/July timeframe, including updates Q1 earnings (updates on Casgevy sales) and data readouts on clinical programs. Outstanding question: is the healthcare system ready for curative one-time therapies, as compared to daily or weekly treatments.

*My Credentials:* I have a MS in Biotech and wrapping up my MBA in healthcare. I have worked in Pharma business development for a few years now. I have been following CRSP since its IPO in 2018.

*My position:*

[Adding more on dips](https://preview.redd.it/5if8gtja9jpe1.png?width=2156&format=png&auto=webp&s=308e2ceb065c32bcc0f5a67050baa8e65715c77e)

**Background**

CRSP is a company developing medicine for genetic diseases using CRISPR gene editing technology. The scientists who discovered this technology won the Nobel Prize in 2020. CRSP has one marketed product, Casgvey, that was developed via a collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals to treat sickle cell disease. They have a profit sharing arrangement, which entitles them to 40% of all profits from Casgevy, while Vertex manages the commercialization. This is great because they have a built-up commercial team which has shown success at getting reimbursement from insurance and getting doctors to prescribe expensive treatments.

The CEO says that they hope to be $100B biotech one day!!

\*\*Financials (\*\*As of 3/18/2025)

Market Cap = $3.67B; Enterprise Value = $1.8B

Net Cash = $1.9B

Short interest = 24.7% of the float (significant short squeeze potential)

\~70% Institutional Investors (Smart Money)

They have an average operating expenses of \~$130M/quarter, so absent any revenue from Casgevy we can expect them to have funding to last at least the next three years and by then it is highly likely that there will be significant profits from Casgevy. This means that at the very least the dilution risk very low, which is common among pre-revenue biotech companies and is the main reason why they are often heavily shorted.

**Macro**

Rate cut/growth scare means biotech boom.

**Commercial Success**

The CEO has said that there is tremendous patient interest in the therapy, and more will be convinced as additional long-term safety data is generated. CEO also says that they are currently ramping up approved treatments center - both the number of centers and how many patients each can treat.

Several analysts have projected that Casgevy could reach $1B in sales as of 2026 and reach peak sales of $3.5B in 2030, per typical drug sales ramps. As EOY24 there are 50 patients undergoing the Casgevy therapy process, as more treatment centers continue to open. This therapy costs $2.2M and these 50 patients equate to sales of $110 million, but it is unknown when that will be collected and if that is enough for profit to begin flowing to CRSP. It only takes a few dozen patients to be treated for this therapy to yield serious revenue, for example, that $1B target equates to 450 patients being treated, out of a US patient pool of around 30k, who are healthy enough to receive the treatment and have access through insurance. However, this can‚Äôt continue forever and once you treat all the available patients, you are only able to treat this disease at the incidence rate (# of babies born with sickle cell) but remember that if Casgevy treats only half of that 30k patient population, it will have made over $33B.

Recently there has been significant process at negotiating access for this therapy on both Medicare/Medicaid and private insurance companies. The consensus insurance approach is outcomes-based agreements (OBA), which would tie a portion of the payments to how well the treatment provide clinical benefit to patients ([Link](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/innovation/innovation-models/cgt)). This is critical in providing access to patients and increasing commercial uptake.

Now let‚Äôs take a look at my NPV projections based on the analyst estimates above.

Projected NPV of $6B, considering the enterprise value of $1.8B, this implies upside of \~233% or a share price of \~$132. For reference the average analyst price target is \~$77.

**Assumptions**

|| || |¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Assumes 50% FCF margin| |¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Discount rate of 12%| |¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Perpetual growth of 3% (very conservative, given pipeline)| |¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 40% profit sharing in Casgevy| |¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Peak sales for Casgevy in 2030 estimated to be $3.5B| |¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Only values company on Casgevy ¬†|

**Competitors**

There is one other gene edit therapy in sickle cell develop by BlueBird, but they essentially just went bankrupt and sold to a private equity for pennies [(Press Release Link)](https://investor.bluebirdbio.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bluebird-bio-announces-definitive-agreement-be-acquired-carlyle). Not to mention their therapy also has a black box warning for hematological malignancies, which is the kiss of death for therapies where there is a suitable alternative. Who would want to risk getting cancer?¬† Their therapy also costs $1M more than Casgevy.

Since traditional medicine aka the previous standard of care only addressed the symptoms of sickle cell, we expect almost no competition from the current market landscape.¬†

There are likely to be several similar therapies from other gene editing competitor coming to market in the next 3-5 years, but the first-to-market usually secures a solid market share.

**Clinical Pipeline**

CRSP also has a solid extensive pipeline of moderately de-risked assets in development. CEO says that commercial success in Casgevy will fund them to make strategic bets to fill their pipeline with 1-2 new drugs per year.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **CTX310; CTX320** = Two candidates in vivo liver editing programs targeting LPA and ANGPTL3, which expects data to be release in 1H 2025 (recent presentations suggest between early April and early May). The CEO stated that they will benefit from economies of scale. The first program in their liver editing platform will cost \~$100M and each subsequent one will only cost $15M to develop because it‚Äôs a modular platform.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **CTX112; CTX131** = Two allogenic CAR-T cell therapy candidates targeting CD19 and CD70, which expect data to be released in mid-2025 and Q4 2025, respectively. Low COGS on allogenic CAR-Ts make them a very attractive business model, even if clinical data is only OK. AstraZeneca reached paid $1B for EsoBiotec, an allogenic CAR-T platform that is in the clinic. ([Link](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/astrazeneca-buy-esobiotec-upto-1-billion-2025-03-17/))

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **VCTX210; VCTX211** = Two regenerative medicine cell therapy replacement candidates for Type 1 Diabetes, which expects an update in 2H 2025. We should be cautious about expecting much from this because their partner, Vertex, has opted out of ownership and we do not know if that is because they plan to focus on their own cell therapy replacement or if something went wrong in the trial.¬† CEO seemed upbeat about it in a recent presentation.

It's also important to note that CRSP wholly owns all the clinical programs above, so contrary to Casgevy, they will receive 100% of the profits. Feel free to look at their [pipeline](https://crisprtx.com/pipeline) for more in depth analysis, but that is not the focus of this research.¬† There are also several pre-clinical programs, but those will materially affect the stock price in my view because they are about *at least* 6 years from revenue generation.

**Risks**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Patients may not want to go through the cell depletion conditioning process required for this treatment - it is like chemotherapy.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Insurance companies may not want to pay for the high price tag of Casgevy ($2.2M), despite the long term clinical and cost benefits. Developing gene editing medicines is not a validated and proven business model (very different economics from small molecules and biologics)

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Safety Risks. Unknown new clinical data could come out which suggests that there are risks associated with CRISPR based medicine compared to more novel and targeted gene editing approaches like base editing or prime editing. Not sure what these would be, but it‚Äôs definitely possible.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Efficacy Risks. Any of the their clinical programs might not generate enough efficacy to beat standard of care (however it is widely accepted that precision medicine companies have significantly higher success rates).

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Competitors still in the clinic could deliver better data that would be the new standard of care in sickle cell, which limits long term growths for Casgevy

1. First, the ""picks and shovels"" plays in AI data centers, which contributed $4.5 trillion (24% of the S&P's gains), with NVDA leading the charge, accounting for 69% (nice) of this group's gains. While in my table I‚Äôve focused on some of the major players in this space, it's likely I've left out many others, meaning these figures almost certainly underestimate the full impact.
2. Second, the rest of the Magnificent 7, which have benefited in various ways from the AI narrative, added an additional $5.2 trillion (27% of the S&P's gains).

Now, the big question is: Is the AI trade simply losing some juice, or are we witnessing the start of a full-blown reversal? Since the DeepSeek event, these names have collectively shed $1.3 trillion, suggesting the latter might not be easily dismissed.

What does this mean for the S&P going forward? The rest of the pack will have to pick up the slack if we are to see some gains this year, and that is without even considering the big R word.

Edit: figured out how to add the image.

I remember it was like $50 a share in the meme run of 2020. A Disney/Hulu merger was announced in January, causing the stock to run from $1.50 to like $5. 

It‚Äôs since cooled down in the tariff talk. The company is not profitable, but seems to be trending that way. 

Curious to know what you think about the long term viability of FUBO and if this stock has any energy left in it for a run to $10+. 

I personally have a couple concerns. I've dealt with these low priced stocks in the dollar range, and they're always super risky. They seem to usually be dilution machines and at the risk of a reverse split. I don't know if this has ever been discussed with regards to FUBO.

There is always the chance the Disney/FUBU merger is shut down by government as well.

It has potential, just thought I'd see what others may have to say about the stock and if they have a position."

Anyway, let me explain why I think it‚Äôs time to load the boat on shares on $FLOW / Flow traders. This company, and especially how it‚Äôs a play to cash in on the recent market volatility and their blowout earnings report.

They‚Äôre a global liquidity provider. They capitalize on market volatility by trading a wide range of financial products, including ETFs, equities, and digital assets. In short for every trade, Flow Traders earns green dildos

# The Play: Buying $FLOW on takeaways from their blowout quarter

Flow Traders has been crushing it with their trading strategies and capital expansion plan, and the recent increase in market volatility means their trading income went through the roof.

Think about it: with the current macroeconomic uncertainties, geopolitical turmoil, and unexpected changes in central bank interest rate policies, volatility levels have spiked. Flow Traders is set to rake in massive trading income from these market conditions.

# Why Flow Traders' Recent Success Signals Big Wins üöÄ

Flow Traders' Q4 2024 earnings smashed expectations, revealing major growth in their trading income‚Äîa sector they dominate. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

1. [**Record-Breaking Quarter](https://www.flowtraders.com/news/flow-traders-4q-2024-results/)**: Flow Traders recorded Net Trading Income of ‚Ç¨153.8 million in Q4 2024, an increase of 112% compared to Q4 2023.This showcases their ability to capitalize on market volatility.
2. **Market Capitalization Increase**: The company ended 2024 with record levels of Trading Capital and Shareholders‚Äô Equity at ‚Ç¨775 million and ‚Ç¨766 million, respectively. This solid financial foundation positions them well for future growth.
3. **Volatility Surge**: The increase in volatility due to macroeconomic uncertainties and geopolitical turmoil has created opportunities for Flow Traders to capture temporary price dislocations and generate significant trading income 

Flow Traders‚Äô results confirm that they are well-positioned to benefit from the current market conditions. $FLOW is poised to ride this wave of growth.

# Financials: A Strong Foundation 

* **Q4 2024 Performance**:
   * Net Trading Income: ‚Ç¨153.8 million (+112% YoY)
   * Total Income: ‚Ç¨159.0 million (+114% YoY)

   * EBITDA: ‚Ç¨214.9 million (+218% YoY)

Note: they had an amazing dividend in 2023. However they choose to use that money for further growth and the business seeing the upside of it in the last Q.

**TL;DR**

Teekay Tankers (TNK): The Hidden Winner of the Tariff War,19,1j3hqq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1j3hqq9/teekay_tankers_tnk_the_hidden_winner_of_the/,11,2025-03-04 23:59:18,"Teekay Tankers (NYSE: TNK) stands to benefit from the current trade dynamics and longer-term geopolitical shifts, potentially making it a compelling investment in today's volatile market.

# Short-Term Catalyst: Tariffs and Trade Route Changes

With the U.S. imposing tariffs (10-20%) on Canadian crude imports, Canadian producers will likely begin exploring alternative markets. While the U.S. remains Canada's primary customer, higher costs could temporarily push some oil onto tankers headed for overseas markets, particularly in Asia and Europe. Increased tanker traffic means longer shipping distances and higher daily charter rates, directly benefiting tanker companies like Teekay Tankers. One of the reasons why the oil is tariffed less than other goods is to ensure that the tariff is just high enough to put it on the edge of shipping oil to other refineries, but this is just the short term catalyst. Shipping oil to an overseas refinery will add about 10% to the cost of the finished product which means the oil won't immediately flow overseas, but it will start. With Europe still heavily sanctioning Russia and Canada/Mexico being heavily tariffed, new trade routes will be utilized over the coming months. However, this is just a short term catalyst.

# Long-Term Catalyst: Potential Return of Russian Oil Imports

If the US rolls over and sanctions are lifted against Russa, Russian crude shipments to the U.S. would resume, significantly increasing tanker demand. Russian crude, such as Urals blend, transported from Russian ports to the U.S. Gulf Coast or East Coast refineries, would generate higher tanker utilization rates, boosting Teekay's revenues substantially. Per barrel it would probably cost >8$ to ship from Russia to the Gulf Coast refineries which at current oil prices is roughly around 10% (equal to Trumps tariffs). This makes it economically viable for Russia to sell Ural oil to the United States, not to mention that since they've been sanctioned for so long they are probably just bursting to sell some non-dark-shipped oil to the global market.

Not to mention that in this scenario Canada would also likely start shipping more oil overseas. The trade routes will be absolutely wonky. Russia shipping to the USA, Canada shipping to Europe.

# Financial Health & Valuation

Teekay Tankers (NYSE: TNK) is currently trading below its book value, offering investors an appealing valuation. In a recession where inflation will be an issue it's often recommended to trade in commodities because they hold their value while everything else loses value to inflation or just loses value straight up. You know what doesn't lose value? Capital assets in a growing sector. TNK owns their ships outright and is currently trading at less than their fleet value (which is normal for a shipping company). It's a safe haven AND a growth sector:

* **Fleet Asset Value:**¬†Approximately $1.548 billion
* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**¬†Extremely low at \~0.03, minimal debt concerns
* **Market Cap vs. Asset Value:**¬†Currently trading below book value, TNK offers a compelling valuation opportunity.E

# The Win-Win Scenario

* **Short-term:**¬†Trade tariffs disrupt established North American crude logistics, increasing tanker demand.
* **Long-term:**¬†Potential reopening of Russian crude routes to the U.S. market significantly expands TNK's long-haul demand, further elevating long-term profitability.

# Investment Thesis:

* **Near-term upside:**¬†Immediate tanker rate boosts due to trade disruptions.
* **Long-term potential:**¬†Major upside from resuming Russian crude imports.
* **Financially attractive:**¬†Trading below book value with minimal debt risk.

Given this scenario,¬†**Teekay Tankers (TNK)**¬†offers an attractive risk-reward profile while the rest of the market dumps, expect TNK to offer a safe haven & growth. Investors looking for a sector-specific play during geopolitical disruptions should seriously consider this undervalued tanker operator.

DD: Most Undervalued Mid-Cap (CORZ) (very long and detailed analysis),15,1j9v90b,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j9v90b,17,2025-03-13 02:54:46,"TL;DR: Core Scientific (NASDAQ: CORZ) is wildly undervalued and the market is sleeping on it. This company has transformed from a troubled Bitcoin miner into a data center powerhouse riding the AI wave ‚Äì and it‚Äôs already generating serious revenue. With a massive $12B OpenAI deal validating its strategy (through partner CoreWeave), a high-margin, long-term AI hosting contract kicking in, and Wall Street still pricing it like a simple crypto miner, CORZ presents a high-upside, strong conviction play. I hold 5,000 shares and couldn‚Äôt be more confident. Below I‚Äôll break down why I believe CORZ can rip higher in the short, medium, and long term ‚Äì with price targets of $12 (short-term), $20 (medium-term), and $30+ (long-term) ‚Äì based on hard data and catalysts the market is blatantly overlooking.

From Bitcoin Miner to AI Data Center Leader

Core Scientific operates large-scale data centers (like its Denton, TX facility pictured above) that were originally built for Bitcoin mining ‚Äì and it‚Äôs now repurposing this infrastructure to power the AI revolution.

Just a year ago, Core Scientific was known primarily as one of North America‚Äôs largest Bitcoin miners. It mined a record 13,762 BTC in 2023 ‚Äì more than any other publicly traded miner Ôøº. But after navigating a tough crypto bear market and slashing $400M of debt in bankruptcy restructuring (saving ~$60M in interest costs annually Ôøº), CORZ emerged in 2024 with a new lease on life and a new mission. Management recognized the huge opportunity in AI and high-performance computing (HPC), and they‚Äôve struck a game-changing deal to pivot into that space Ôøº Ôøº.

Today, Core Scientific isn‚Äôt just a crypto play ‚Äì it‚Äôs fast becoming a major data center player for AI. In June 2024, the company inked a transformative 12-year contract to provide ~200 megawatts (MW) of its data center capacity to CoreWeave, the AI cloud provider Ôøº. Under this deal, CORZ will host CoreWeave‚Äôs cutting-edge NVIDIA GPU rigs in its facilities, effectively turning its mining centers into AI supercomputing hubs. The site modifications are already underway and expected to be operational by mid-2025 Ôøº. This is a big deal ‚Äì literally. Once fully up and running, that initial contract is estimated to generate **over $3.5 billion in revenue for Core Scientific over 12 years (about $290M per year) Ôøº. Even better, the hosting revenues come with approx. 75‚Äì80% gross margins Ôøº, far more predictable and stable than volatile Bitcoin mining profits. In other words, CORZ is locking in a decade of high-margin, recurring cash flow from the AI boom.

And that‚Äôs just the beginning. CoreWeave was so satisfied that it exercised an option for an extra 70 MW within weeks Ôøº, expanding the partnership. This adds another ~$1.2B in contracted revenue (bringing total HPC contract value to ~$4.7B!) Ôøº Ôøº. All told, CORZ now has ~500 MW of its capacity contracted for AI/HPC through CoreWeave between 2025‚Äì2026 Ôøº Ôøº. For context, that is massive scale ‚Äì comparable to or bigger than many established data center operators. In fact, with 1.2 GW (1,200 MW) of total power capacity across its sites, Core Scientific is positioned to be one of the largest data center operators in the U.S. Ôøº Ôøº. Roughly 70% of its infrastructure is now earmarked for AI/HPC hosting versus 30% for Bitcoin, yet the stock still isn‚Äôt being valued like a data center company Ôøº. This disconnect is our opportunity.

Future Profitability & Growth Trajectory üöÄ

The growth trajectory here is off the charts. Core Scientific‚Äôs legacy mining business is already cash-generative (especially with Bitcoin rebounding ‚Äì BTC has climbed from ~$17k at end of 2022 to ~$43k by end of 2023 Ôøº, greatly improving mining economics). CORZ continues to mine ~16‚Äì19 BTC per day from its own fleet Ôøº Ôøº, and it‚Äôs deploying next-gen miners to boost efficiency. But the real game-changer is the HPC hosting side coming online:
	‚Ä¢	Stable High-Margin Revenue: Starting in 2025, Core Scientific will begin raking in ~$290M/year in AI hosting revenue from the CoreWeave contract Ôøº. Unlike mining, this is dollar-denominated, fixed-fee revenue ‚Äì not subject to coin price swings. Gross margins are expected to be 75‚Äì80% Ôøº, which will supercharge profitability. Essentially, CORZ is becoming a hybrid of a crypto miner and a high-margin data center REIT.
	‚Ä¢	Predictable Cash Flow: Management highlighted that AI hosting provides a level of predictability that mining lacks Ôøº. Power costs and BTC prices can whipsaw mining profits, but the HPC contracts lock in client payments and even have the client (CoreWeave) funding much of the build-out capex Ôøº. This dramatically de-risks the business model going forward. We‚Äôre talking recurring revenue for 12+ years from Tier-1 AI clients.
	‚Ä¢	Expansion and Upside: Core Scientific isn‚Äôt stopping at 270 MW for CoreWeave. They have ~130+ MW of additional capacity ready to contract with other AI customers Ôøº Ôøº. Management explicitly said they are in discussions with other potential HPC clients to capitalize on their ‚Äúsignificant pipeline of powered real estate‚Äù Ôøº. The demand is there ‚Äì in fact, analysts at the recent investor day swarmed them with questions about the AI contracts, not mining Ôøº, showing where the future lies. Any new contracts (think other cloud providers, government, universities, etc.) would be gravy on top of the CoreWeave deal. There‚Äôs room to easily sign hundreds more MW in the coming years, given their planned expansions in Oklahoma, Georgia, Alabama and more.
	‚Ä¢	Operating Leverage: With debt reduced and interest costs down, plus legacy infrastructure already in place, much of the new revenue will drop to the bottom line. Even before the AI pivot, CORZ was delivering positive adjusted EBITDA. Now, factor in $300M+ of high-margin annual AI revenue, plus a potential Bitcoin bull cycle (post-2024 halving and potential ETF approvals) boosting mining profits‚Ä¶ you get the picture. This company could be printing cash in 2025 and beyond. Bernstein analysts actually project CORZ turning net-profitable in 2025 as the AI hosting ramps up Ôøº. The ‚Äúcrypto miner that went bankrupt‚Äù narrative is outdated ‚Äì Core Scientific is now a cash flow machine in the making.

Bottom line: The growth trajectory is dual-powered ‚Äì steady AI hosting revenue growth and optionality on Bitcoin‚Äôs upside. If BTC runs again (many expect a major move in the next 1-2 years due to the halving and institutional adoption), CORZ‚Äôs mining division (still one of the largest with ~19.4 EH/s hashpower Ôøº Ôøº) will mint money. If BTC stagnates, CORZ still wins big from AI. This balanced model means multiple shots on goal for explosive growth. It‚Äôs hard to find a company with this kind of asymmetric upside already trading at a single-digit stock price.

OpenAI‚Äôs $12B Deal Validates CORZ‚Äôs Long-Term Vision

One of the strongest confirmations of Core Scientific‚Äôs strategy came just this week: OpenAI signed a $12 billion, five-year deal with CoreWeave Ôøº. Yes, the same CoreWeave that partnered with CORZ. This is huge news for the AI infrastructure space and hugely bullish for Core Scientific by association.

Why? OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT) is essentially saying they need massive GPU cloud capacity outside of Microsoft. CoreWeave, which specializes in GPU hosting, is now on the hook to deliver a ton of AI compute to OpenAI Ôøº. We‚Äôre talking about potentially building out one of the world‚Äôs largest AI supercomputing footprints. And guess who is a key supplier of that footprint? Core Scientific.

CoreWeave has contracted 500 MW of Core Scientific‚Äôs data centers to meet its clients‚Äô AI needs Ôøº. The OpenAI deal alone will likely soak up every bit of that and more, meaning CoreWeave may need to exercise further expansion options with CORZ or invest in new sites (likely both). It underscores that demand for AI data center capacity is practically insatiable right now. In 2024, CoreWeave‚Äôs revenue exploded 8√ó from $229M to $1.9 billion thanks largely to AI deals with customers like Microsoft Ôøº. Now with OpenAI‚Äôs multi-year $12B commitment, CoreWeave‚Äôs revenue will go parabolic ‚Äì and Core Scientific is integral to supplying that growth Ôøº.

To put it simply: the AI gold rush is on, and CORZ is selling the shovels (power + space). The OpenAI-CoreWeave partnership de-risks Core Scientific‚Äôs long-term prospects even further. It‚Äôs tangible proof that AI compute is the future, and CORZ‚Äôs massive power infrastructure is exactly what‚Äôs needed to capitalize on it. Every major AI player will be scrambling for data center capacity. Core Scientific has some of the largest ready-to-go sites in North America ‚Äì a fact not lost on those in the know. (Remember, CoreWeave even tried to acquire Core Scientific for $5.75/share in cash Ôøº last year, and was flatly rejected as ‚Äúundervalued‚Äù ‚Äì more on that below.)

Oh, and about Microsoft ‚Äì there was a fear floating around that Microsoft might back away from using CoreWeave (which could have indirectly hurt CORZ). That rumor was put to rest decisively. CoreWeave denied any contract cancellations with Microsoft and called such reports ‚Äúfalse and misleading‚Äù Ôøº. In fact, Microsoft has massive multi-year plans with CoreWeave (reportedly intending to spend $10B+ on CoreWeave‚Äôs services by 2030) Ôøº. So the largest customer relationships are intact, and now OpenAI is piling on with its own gargantuan deal. In short, the HPC side of CORZ‚Äôs business is rock-solid and about to experience torrid growth on the back of these AI mega-deals.

Market Misperception: Not Just a ‚ÄúMining Company‚Äù Anymore

Despite everything outlined above, many investors still think of Core Scientific as a Bitcoin mining stock. Old habits die hard ‚Äì and that‚Äôs why this opportunity exists. The stock came out of bankruptcy in January and was re-listed at just a few bucks, and many probably wrote it off as ‚Äúanother crypto casualty.‚Äù The reality couldn‚Äôt be more different now. CORZ is morphing into a hybrid AI infrastructure play, but the market hasn‚Äôt caught up to this narrative yet.

Here‚Äôs the misperception: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a miner, so it should trade at mining valuations.‚Äù Many mining companies trade at low multiples because of volatile earnings and past boom-bust cycles. Core Scientific, however, now has much more in common with data center operators like Equinix (EQIX) or Digital Realty (DLR) than with pure miners. Don‚Äôt take my word for it ‚Äì Bernstein‚Äôs tech analyst Gautam Chhugani explicitly notes that CORZ‚Äôs valuation today ‚Äúaligns more closely with Bitcoin mining rather than data center valuations, [even though] 70% of its capacity is dedicated to AI.‚Äù Ôøº In other words, Wall Street is pricing CORZ all wrong. The company is being valued like a shrinking, risky crypto miner when in fact it‚Äôs a growing, diversified digital infrastructure firm with both crypto and AI tailwinds.

Consider this: Core Scientific will have 800+ MW in HPC data centers and ~400 MW in mining. Equinix, the king of data centers, operates ~240 data centers globally, but their total power capacity is on the order of only a few hundred MW in many markets. Digital Realty similarly has a large footprint but trades at 20+ times FFO (funds from operations) because of its stable data center income. Core Scientific‚Äôs HPC contracts are bringing in exactly that kind of stable income, yet CORZ trades at a tiny fraction of the valuation metrics of EQIX/DLR. It‚Äôs like buying a data center stock for the price of a distressed crypto stock ‚Äì a total disconnect.

Let‚Äôs put some numbers on it: At around ~$8‚Äì9 per share (as of this week), CORZ‚Äôs market cap is roughly $4.5 billion (the market hasn‚Äôt updated fully to the growth story) Ôøº. For that price, you‚Äôre getting 1.2 GW of capacity, $4.7B in contracted AI revenue over the next decade, plus the largest Bitcoin mining operation in North America (which mined 6,300+ BTC in 2024) Ôøº. By contrast, DLR‚Äôs market cap is around $30B and Equinix‚Äôs is around $70B ‚Äì and neither of them has a call option on Bitcoin reaching six figures üòâ.

Now, I‚Äôm not saying CORZ should be worth $30B today, but it absolutely deserves a major re-rating as it proves out this HPC pivot. The company itself recognized the undervaluation: remember, when CoreWeave offered $5.75/share cash for the company last summer, the board rejected it for undervaluing CORZ Ôøº. That was when Bitcoin was lower and before the $12B OpenAI deal even existed ‚Äì so imagine how much more they‚Äôd scoff at $5.75 now. Insiders clearly believe the company is worth a lot more, and so do I.

Every earnings report and press release going forward is likely to shift the narrative and wake more investors up. Already, research analysts are taking note. Besides Bernstein (Buy, $17 PT), KBW initiated coverage with a Buy and a $22 target Ôøº. The language from these analysts is telling ‚Äì they highlight CORZ‚Äôs ‚Äústrategic partnerships with cloud players like CoreWeave‚Äù and its ability to deploy hybrid AI/Bitcoin data centers quickly as key reasons it‚Äôs ‚Äúwell-placed to capitalize‚Äù on the AI boom Ôøº. This is strong validation that smart money sees the shift. As these data points permeate and the company delivers actual results (e.g., later in 2025 when the AI revenue hits the income statement in a big way), I expect a cascade of revaluation.

In summary, the market‚Äôs old perception = ‚ÄúCORZ is a bankrupt miner, avoid.‚Äù The new reality = ‚ÄúCORZ is a profitable digital infrastructure company with huge AI contracts and a Bitcoin kicker.‚Äù We are still closer to the former in terms of stock price, which is exactly why this is the most undervalued future bet I see right now. The market is asleep at the wheel, and we plan to wake up smiling.

Undervaluation Relative to Peers (EQIX, DLR) ‚Äì By the Numbers

To really drive home how mispriced CORZ is, let‚Äôs do a quick peer comparison. Equinix and Digital Realty are the blue chips of data centers ‚Äì known for steady earnings, high occupancy, etc. Investors pay a premium for that stability. Equinix (EQIX) trades around ~25x EV/EBITDA and ~8x sales. Digital Realty (DLR) trades ~20x EV/EBITDA. Both have dividend yields under 3% ‚Äì meaning investors accept low yields because they trust the long-term demand for data centers. These companies also grow in single-digit percentages per year (organically), with big capex needs to add capacity.

Now look at Core Scientific: In 2024, even without the full HPC ramp, it pulled in about ~$100M per quarter in revenue from mining Ôøº (so ~$400M annual run-rate). Add $290M/yr from the first HPC phase starting 2025 Ôøº, and we get ~$700M annual revenue potential. If Bitcoin prices rise, mining revenue could easily push that over $1 billion. So let‚Äôs ballpark $1B+ revenue in 2025-26. At the current ~$4.5B market cap, that‚Äôs roughly 4.5√ó P/Sales. Equinix by contrast trades at ~10√ó sales. Even if we haircut for the mining portion‚Äôs volatility, CORZ‚Äôs AI hosting portion alone arguably deserves a similar multiple to data center peers once it‚Äôs fully online (given 12-year contracts = very ‚ÄúREIT-like‚Äù revenue). On $300M of high-quality AI revenue, a 10√ó multiple would value that segment at $3B. The mining segment, at 6,000+ BTC/year production (which at $50k BTC would be $300M revenue), could also be worth a few billion easily in a bull case. Sum-of-parts, it‚Äôs not hard to envision $6B‚Äì$8B+ valuation in the near future, which translates to stock price in the mid to high teens. And that doesn‚Äôt account for further AI contracts or Bitcoin reaching new highs, which could push numbers even higher.

Another way to look at it: Enterprise Value per MW of data center capacity. Data centers often change hands at around $10M+ per MW (depending on location and clients). Core Scientific at $4.5B EV for 1,200 MW is only about $3.75M per MW ‚Äì dirt cheap. If you value the 800 MW of AI capacity at, say, $8M/MW (still a discount to typical hyperscale DC deals, considering these are cutting-edge GPU facilities), that‚Äôs $6.4B right there. Add some value for the 400 MW mining capacity (which isn‚Äôt worthless ‚Äì it produces BTC and can be repurposed if needed), and you easily justify $8B‚Äì$10B EV. That would put the stock roughly in the $20s. It‚Äôs not pie-in-the-sky; it‚Äôs just basic sum-of-parts with reasonable peer comps.

Finally, remember that Core Scientific‚Äôs management already turned down a full cash buyout at $5.75 because they believed it wasn‚Äôt fair value Ôøº. They had much more insight into their pipeline and prospects (and boy, were they right ‚Äì since then we‚Äôve seen the AI pipeline explode). Insiders are aligned with us in wanting a MUCH higher price. As an investor, that refusal of a buyout is incredibly bullish ‚Äì it tells me management genuinely thinks the stock is worth multiples of that offer.

Key Catalysts Ahead

This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúsit and wait for years‚Äù story ‚Äì I see multiple near-term and medium-term catalysts that could rerate CORZ significantly. Here are the key ones to watch:
	‚Ä¢	HPC Go-Live (Mid-2025): In the next few months, Core Scientific will be completing the modifications and powering up that first 200 MW for CoreWeave‚Äôs AI workloads Ôøº. When that goes live (anticipated H1 2025), CORZ can start recognizing the hosting revenue. We might get updates or even initial revenue in Q3 2025 results. The market often prices things in early, so as this milestone nears, expect increasing buzz around CORZ as an ‚ÄúAI infrastructure play‚Äù. There may also be ribbon-cutting PR events (like the one in Muskogee, OK for a new 100 MW center Ôøº Ôøº) to draw investor attention.
	‚Ä¢	New HPC Contracts: Management has hinted at discussions with additional AI/cloud clients Ôøº. Any announcement of a new contract (e.g., leasing another 100+ MW to a different hyperscaler or government project) would be a huge catalyst. It would prove CoreWeave isn‚Äôt the only one knocking on the door. Keep an eye on press releases ‚Äì CORZ has been expanding into new regions (recently Auburn, Alabama facility announced in Feb 2025 Ôøº Ôøº) specifically to support more HPC customers. We could wake up to a headline like ‚ÄúCore Scientific signs $X billion contract with [Big Tech or Government] for AI data center capacity‚Äù ‚Äì and the stock would likely gap up on that.
	‚Ä¢	Bitcoin Halving & ETF Mania: The Bitcoin halving in April 2024 cut block rewards in half, which historically precedes big BTC bull runs in the subsequent year or two. We‚Äôre now post-halving, and there‚Äôs a strong narrative for a 2025 crypto upcycle (potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF by BlackRock or others, increased mainstream adoption, etc.). If Bitcoin‚Äôs price surges, Core Scientific‚Äôs mining profitability will skyrocket (since they are highly leveraged to BTC price, mining 16+ BTC daily). Even a move back to Bitcoin‚Äôs prior highs ($60k‚Äì$65k) would more than double mining revenue from current levels. That would provide upside surprise in earnings and further cash to invest in expansions or pay down any remaining debt. In short, a crypto bull run would be icing on the cake ‚Äì not required for our thesis, but it could send the stock into an even higher gear.
	‚Ä¢	CoreWeave IPO: CoreWeave filed for an IPO in March 2025 Ôøº. When that IPO happens, it will likely shine a big spotlight on the value of AI infrastructure companies. If CoreWeave comes out with a huge valuation (some speculate tens of billions given the OpenAI deal and revenue trajectory), people will do the math and realize ‚Äúhey, a big chunk of CoreWeave‚Äôs infrastructure is actually provided by Core Scientific.‚Äù Investors might look for a cheaper proxy ‚Äì and CORZ fits the bill perfectly. Essentially, CORZ could get a sympathy re-rating when CoreWeave IPOs, as a way to play the AI data center theme without paying an IPO premium.
	‚Ä¢	Earnings Surprises / Guidance: As soon as CORZ‚Äôs management starts giving forward guidance that includes the HPC contracts, analysts will need to update their models upward. We could see this in late 2024 or early 2025 earnings calls, where they might guide for hundreds of millions in hosting revenue in 2025/26. Any hint of raising forecasts will make the stock pop. Additionally, if their monthly operational updates (which currently report BTC mined, etc.) start to include HPC metrics, that will educate the market. They already mention that they are converting a significant portion of data centers to AI workloads Ôøº ‚Äì soon we‚Äôll see actual numbers to attach to that.
	‚Ä¢	Index Inclusion & Institutional Buying: Having emerged from bankruptcy and re-listed on Nasdaq, CORZ can now be included in indices again. It may also graduate from being seen as ‚Äúdistressed‚Äù to being a legitimate growth stock. As fundamentals improve, more institutions will be able to buy in (some couldn‚Äôt touch it during bankruptcy or OTC trading). We might also see hedge funds and big-name investors take positions once they recognize the turnaround. Any such filings or mentions (e.g., a famous value investor or tech fund taking a stake) would be a catalyst.

In short, there is no shortage of catalysts. This isn‚Äôt some cigar-butt value trap ‚Äì it‚Äôs a dynamic situation with news flow likely skewed to the positive for quite some time. Wall Street is behind the curve, and each catalyst is an alarm clock ringing to wake them up.

Strong Conviction: My Price Targets (Short, Medium, Long Term)

I‚Äôve laid out the facts and the thesis ‚Äì now let‚Äôs talk price targets and upside. As mentioned, I‚Äôm holding 5,000 shares of CORZ and I intend to hold (if not add) because I see massive upside from current levels. Here‚Äôs where I realistically see the stock going:
	‚Ä¢	Short Term (next 3‚Äì6 months): $12+ ‚Äì In the short run, I expect CORZ to trade into the double digits as the market starts pricing in the HPC contract ramp and the AI news flow. Recall that management already said $5.75 was too low Ôøº; we‚Äôre now well above that, but still in single digits. I think $10‚Äì$12 is very achievable on just a bit more recognition, which would still only be ~5x sales and a discount to peers. Short-term catalysts like continued strong Bitcoin production (they mined 471 BTC just in the first two months of 2025 Ôøº) and any hints of additional AI deals could push us to this range quickly. In my view, the downside is pretty limited now that the company is out of bankruptcy and cash-flow positive, so risk/reward is skewed to the upside. Near-term target: $12.
	‚Ä¢	Medium Term (12‚Äì18 months): $18‚Äì$20 ‚Äì Over the next year or so (by end of 2025), I see CORZ in the high teens at least. This coincides with the period when the CoreWeave contract will be fully operational and printing revenue. Bernstein‚Äôs official target is $17 Ôøº, and KBW‚Äôs is $22 Ôøº; my own model splits the difference. By 2025, the company should be solidly profitable, with perhaps $300M+ annual EBITDA (my rough estimate combining mining + hosting). Slapping even a 10√ó EBITDA multiple would give ~$3B enterprise value, and I suspect CORZ will command higher given growth rates ‚Äì hence a stock around $18‚Äì20 makes sense. This also assumes Bitcoin maybe in the $40k‚Äì$50k range (conservative) and no major new HPC contracts beyond what‚Äôs announced (also conservative). Any positive surprise (e.g., BTC at $70k or another 100MW contract) and we could easily break $20. 12‚Äì18 month target: ~$20.
	‚Ä¢	Long Term (2‚Äì3 years+): $30+ (multi-bagger) ‚Äì Looking out a few years, I believe CORZ can trade north of $30, making it a potential multi-bagger from here. By that time (2026‚Äì2027), Core Scientific could have several AI clients, 800+ MW of AI load generating perhaps $600M+/yr in revenue, and still mining a significant amount of Bitcoin with next-next-gen ASICs (they are already planning 2025 miner refresh with 3nm chips Ôøº). If Bitcoin hits new all-time highs in that timeframe (which I personally expect), the mining side alone could be worth the current market cap (!). Meanwhile, the data center side would be maturing into a full-fledged co-location giant. It‚Äôs not crazy to think CORZ could approach a $10B+ valuation if all cylinders fire ‚Äì which would put the stock roughly in the $30s. Consider that the company nearly sold for ~$6B ($5.75/share) when it was in bankruptcy distress; with a stronger balance sheet and booming business, $30 (equating to maybe ~$15B if dilution is minimal) is a reasonable long-term aspiration. And if we dream a bit: should CORZ eventually spin off its AI data center arm as a REIT or get acquired by a big player, we could see even more upside. But I‚Äôll stay grounded and stick to $30+ as my long-term base case. That‚Äôs roughly a triple from here ‚Äì exactly the kind of asymmetrical upside that deep due diligence can uncover.

Conclusion: High-Upside, Well-Researched, and the Market is Asleep

To wrap up, Core Scientific is, in my opinion, the most undervalued ‚Äúpicks and shovels‚Äù play on both AI and crypto out there. The company has already proven resilient ‚Äì surviving a brutal downturn, emerging stronger, and immediately seizing one of the biggest opportunities of our era (AI compute). They are already profitable on an operating basis, have secured billions in future revenues, and still retain the explosive upside of Bitcoin mining. Yet, because it‚Äôs a former bankrupt crypto name, most investors haven‚Äôt caught on to the transformation. This is the kind of setup deep-value and growth investors dream about: a misunderstood stock with improving fundamentals and multiple catalysts on deck.

I‚Äôm pounding the table with strong conviction on CORZ. I‚Äôve put my money where my mouth is (5,000 shares and holding) because I see what others are missing. If you believe in the future of AI (and the infrastructure needed to run it) and you believe in the long-term value of Bitcoin, this is a no-brainer combination play. Even if you‚Äôre only bullish on one of those, CORZ offers a compelling risk-reward skew.

The market is clearly sleeping on this opportunity, but it won‚Äôt stay asleep forever. The facts are coming out quarter by quarter, contract by contract. In my view, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before Core Scientific is re-rated from ‚Äúex-miner penny stock‚Äù to ‚Äúpremier digital infrastructure growth stock.‚Äù By then, the easy money will have been made. That‚Äôs why the time to get in is now, while it‚Äôs undervalued and before the broader market wakes up.

Disclosure: I am long CORZ (5,000 shares) and have no plans to sell in the foreseeable future. I wrote this DD because I believe in the thesis and want to share the research ‚Äì but of course, do your own due diligence. This is not financial advice, just one highly confident investor‚Äôs perspective. I welcome any counterpoints or additional insights.

Any AI experts? What role does GPT 4.5 have on current NVDA sinking?,15,1j37bkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1j37bkg/any_ai_experts_what_role_does_gpt_45_have_on/,35,2025-03-04 15:21:46,"gpt 4.5 not break any benchmarks and even worse than some other models. It got made fun of by the entire AI influencer community.

And this is supposed to be OpenAI's biggest model, so big that it's like 10x more expensive than other apis.

It might signal that's there's limits to scaling model sizes, which would slash forecasts on the number GPU's people are going to buy.

Combine that with deepseek reaching great levels with much less compute, and that may signal that there is a limit of number of GPUs people need to reach the highest levels of AI.

The idea is for merchants to invite their vendors into the PayPal network to facilitate easier transactions, according to Michelle Gill, general manager of PayPal‚Äôs small business and financial services group.

Both contracts are deep in the money, limiting the extrinsic value paid to about 3.7%.

As long as market swings one way or the other by the end of the week, and overcoming the 3.7% cost hurdle of potential decay, this should be a profitable trade? No?

Example: since delta cannot equal 1 or 0 as long as time>0, getting contracts initially where both deltas are around 1 means that as long as one side remains net positive, that delta will be 1 and the other will be less than one (until the date of expiry) meaning you will pick up profit with even the slightest move on other side.

[DD] Critical Minerals II: The Domestic Supply Chain Strikes Back,13,1j3bsy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1j3bsy2/dd_critical_minerals_ii_the_domestic_supply_chain/,14,2025-03-04 19:49:30,"Hi all, this is meant to be a followup to the last \[DD\][ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1iuykwm/the_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_but/). The thesis of that post was:

>**Thesis/Summary:** the mining industry presents a massive opportunity anywhere from right now to the end of the present US administration and hopefully beyond. The investments that will matter most have to do with the processing, extraction, separation, and manufacturing of titanium, lithium, and rare earth minerals deemed critical. These investments must be allied with western interests, ideally operating in the United States. The issue that is most relevant is the complete market dominance China has over these metals and rare earth minerals.

In this post, I want to go over further developments in my research on this sector and the subsequent adjustments that I‚Äôve made to my portfolio as a result.¬† I‚Äôll start with a bit of methodology. Among the guiding considerations I have found reasonable:

1. Priority should be given to domestic companies looking to mine, refine, and develop critical metals/minerals in the USA or who may be substantial suppliers of our critical minerals stockpile. Secondary priority should be given to companies that are part of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or otherwise western-aligned, and wishing to mine, refine, or develop critical metals/minerals in the USA, or who may be stockpile suppliers.
2. Priority should be given to companies that have substantial federal contracts already or have projects presently awaiting government permits, funding, or regulative actions, where such action would be expressly in the USA national security interest.
3. Priority should be given to companies that have institutionally and politically well-resourced members involved in their board, leadership, governing body.
4. Priority should be given to companies represented unusually strongly in the portfolio of major hedge funds, have unusual levels of insider activity, and/or are represented in the financial disclosures of politicians in Washington, D.C.¬†
5. Priority should be given to companies that have established they can deliver results or who have a head start in their particular niche of the industry relative to competitors.

Given this, a lot of my research has presently been focused on evaluating degrees of institutional, political, and insider support for the companies that, *prima facie,* appear to have their interests aligned with the federal government in that the success of the company supports federal objectives.

Specifically, here is what I have done since last writing:

1. I combed through the 2024 financial disclosures of the administration and his various cabinet members to evaluate whether they had considerable equity in this sector and, if so, where.
2. I combed through 13F and NPORT filings from the heavy-hitting hedge funds, investment managers, and so on (e.g. Blackrock, Citadel, ‚Ä¶) to evaluate their posturing.
3. I did research into which companies work with which metals/minerals and where, if any, there are bottlenecks in their growth that may be eased w/ deregulation, federal support.
4. I looked into which individuals, with ties to the mining and metals industry, appear to also be tied to, or otherwise cozy with, the president, or members of his administration. I then looked into their financial disclosures, etc, as well, at least to the extent possible.
5. Wherever I found an investment firm, LLC, etc, that I did not recognize, but which has been making substantial recent investments in this sector and in the companies I have flagged, I went on to also research who was behind them and their affiliations.

Strategies like this can be hampered by the delay between position adjustments and submission of financial disclosures. Hence, this does have its risks. Nonetheless, I found interesting data. For example, when I was looking into MP materials, I noticed substantial **($200 million+)** investments opened Q4 2024 (that is, as of December 31, 2024)¬† by ‚ÄúHancock Prospecting Pty.‚Äù I also noticed the fund was **$2billion+ in total.** I had never heard of this group.¬† Did a little looking into it and it turns out to be managed by [**Gina Rinehart**](https://www.hancockprospecting.com.au/gina-rinehart-revealed-as-owner-of-2b-us-stock-portfolio/)**,** a mining magnate and Australia‚Äôs richest person, who also happens to be close enough with Mangoes hat [she attended his inauguration party in January](https://www.atlasiron.com.au/pratt-rinehart-to-attend-trumps-inauguration/), alongside the usual cabal of tech billionaires and politicians. Look at this[ adorable photo of her](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/be-like-donald-trump-gina-rinehart-tells-nations-leaders/news-story/86084df17ee039ba0c4c963d1be45256?amp) with Argentina‚Äôs president, Javier Milei, who also attended.

As I said, in Q4 2024, Rinehart‚Äôs fund opened substantial new positions, including $200million+ in MP materials. Of the investments I listed in my last research post, the fund also opened up new positions worth hundreds of millions of dollars in TSLA, ALB, others...

I also learned in this past research cycle that the president has investments in companies like UUUU and CAT, that Kash Patel has investments in MP materials and CAT, and that Ken Griffins (Citadel) increased his share in MP materials by 2500% in Q4 (albeit, he also shifted his derivatives b/w the long Call/Put spread he likes to keep on many of his holdings).

[**John Paulson**,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-05/election-2024-john-paulson-is-raising-43-million-for-trump) a close friend and billionaire supporter of the president, who is perhaps most famous for his bet against the housing market in 2008, which made him $20 billion richer, also has investments in PPTA (Perpetua Resources).

Several of them started scaling up operations 3-5 years ago, which is the minimum, of how long it takes to scale up in mining and they're just starting to see production increases.  

They all go through periods where they spend everything they make and they go through periods where they pile cash.  Which do you think they are in?

This really caught my attention because the ER wasnt particularly good. Despite this, the company is saying that not only they have the cash flow for a 1% annual dividend, but also have enough cash for a 2 billion dollar share buyback.

Ivanhoe mines double bottom today. Low IV. Yolo‚Äôd in today (IVPAF in Murica),5,1ixadpd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ixadpd,14,2025-02-25 00:50:47,"
Ivanhoe flagship asset is located in Kolwezi, Congo. Currently a rebel army M23 from Rwanda has taken over 2 cities near the border. Goma and Bukavu. Both of these cities are shit holes with millions in population but were overtaken by M23‚Äôs minuscule 8000 man army last week. This is what they look like: 10 guys with tiny guns cramming into the back of 15 year old Toyota trucks: https://imgur.com/a/Ed6Rmlo

Ivanhoes asset Kamoa Kakula is a massive copper mine 40% owned by the Chinese. It‚Äôs located 1600km away from the conflict zone. These guys trucks wouldn‚Äôt even be able to make the drive without breaking down even if they wanted to come after it. Their army is also so caveman/obsolete if there ever was a threat the Chinese could send 1 drone and end the war. All of the copper gets shipped to China. There‚Äôs zero chance the operations will be affected by this conflict.

But due to the scare of something happening IVN investors have been selling causing a big dip. The conflict has been happening since the beginning of December leading IVN to dip from $20 to now the $14s. On Feb 3rd IVN dipped to mid $14‚Äôs just like today. Today marks a double bottom and on technicals should rebound to $17-18 within 1-2 weeks. IV is super cheap on this stock, a rise to $18 will make most options 5-15x depending what strike you gamble on. The Congo government is also declaring they will fight M23 and retake their cities. News of the conflict being contained to that region will be bullish for scared IVN sellers to buy back in.

Just last week IVN posted q4 financials and made a record $386mil US profit. Annualized is $1.5billion giving it a tiny PE of 8x. A new zinc mine in another region just came online during Q4 and will add another $100mil to Q1 profits as well as a new mega smelter competed at K&K during our current quarter which will add $0.30 profit for every pound of copper sold. It‚Äôs trading at only 4x 2026 profits. This is a great stock to go long on as well as short options and the time to enter is now.

M&A prospect volatility of backdoor bargaining?,6,1jgo9u4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jgo9u4/ma_prospect_volatility_of_backdoor_bargaining/,5,2025-03-22 00:17:06,"Now that ü•≠ has fired two members of the FTC (arguably the more hawkish ones), he is definitely showing that he is exerting influence in the M&A space and my guess is that he will go ahead and fuck around with the permission of the largest proposed M&As of 2024 like Mars's Acquisition of Kellanova and Capital One's acquisition of Discover. I wouldn't be surprised if his FTC threatens to block them in an effort to extract something from the biggest shareholders involved.

Right now Kellanova ($K) is trading pretty evenly below its $83.5 buyout price but I bet a dip is to come from FTC threats similar to what we've seen recently with Discover Financial Services ($DFS).

This move has caused a sharp drop in the S&P 500 as investors rapidly divest from U.S. equities, sparking a shift towards European and Chinese markets.

On top of that, emerging economies like Turkey, Indonesia, and Colombia are also feeling the pressure due to their own domestic political issues. With so much volatility, do you think this will lead to long-term instability in the global markets, or could this be a short-term reaction?

Could Nvidia's valuation be set to be redefined after GTC?,1,1jef6gt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jef6gt/could_nvidias_valuation_be_set_to_be_redefined/,28,2025-03-19 02:04:54,"NVIDIA (NVDA) is basically the big cheese in the GPU and AI computing world. Here's the lowdown:

* **Consumer GPUs**: Think gaming rigs, content creators, and PC enthusiasts.
* **Data Centers & AI**: Powering massive AI workloads, cloud services, and enterprise data centers.
* **Self-Driving & Robotics**: Venturing into autonomous vehicles, robotics, and edge computing.

**Financials: Show Me the Money**

Let's dive into NVIDIA's financials over the past five years. Spoiler: It's been a wild ride.

|Fiscal Year|Revenue ($B)|Net Income ($B)|EPS ($)|Gross Margin (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2021|16.7|4.3|1.47|62|
|2022|26.9|9.8|3.37|65|
|2023|27.0|10.2|3.55|66|
|2024|30.0|11.5|4.00|67|
|2025\*|35.0|13.0|4.50|68|

\*2025 numbers are guesstimates, so don't @ me if they're off.

**Breaking It Down:**

* **Revenue**: Climbing like a SpaceX rocket, thanks to data centers and AI.
* **Net Income & EPS**: Also on the up and up, showing they're not just making it rain but also stacking those Benjamins efficiently.
* **Gross Margin**: From 62% to an estimated 68%‚Äîthat's some serious cheddar, indicating their products are top-shelf.

**Product Highlights: What's Cooking?**

* **Blackwell Ultra Series**: Dropping later this year, these AI chips (B300/GB300) are beefed up with 288GB memory (up from 192GB) and a 50% performance boost. Data centers are drooling.
* **Full-Stack AI Solutions**: NVIDIA's building an AI empire, making it easier for cloud providers and businesses to hop on their bandwagon and save some coin.
* **Self-Driving & Robotics**: They're not just about GPUs; they're diving into autonomous vehicles and robots, keeping things futuristic.

**GTC 2025: The Hype Is Real**

* **Event Deets**: On March 18 in San Jose, NVIDIA's annual GTC shindig is the place to be for devs, investors, and media folks. Expect AI, robotics, data centers, and self-driving car talk, plus the scoop on Blackwell Ultra chips and the next-gen Rubin GPU architecture.
* **Market Vibes**: Tickets are hotter than a summer in Phoenix, but NVDA stock dipped \~1.76% pre-event. Investors might be biting their nails over production and yield concerns.
* **Catalyst Watch**: Analysts say if NVIDIA clears the air on production and performance at GTC, we could see a stock rally. If not, expect some market side-eye until the next earnings drop.

**6-Month Stock Forecast: Crystal Ball Time**

* **Bearish Scenario**: If new products flop or GTC is a snooze, stock might chill around $120.
* **Bullish Scenario**: If GTC delivers and NVIDIA squashes production fears, we could see $150 or more.
* **Overall Range**: Expect NVDA to dance between $120 and $150 in the next six months.

**Investment Take: To the Moon?**

* **Hold & HODL**: Most analysts are saying ""buy"" or ""hold,"" betting on NVIDIA's long-term game in AI, data centers, and self-driving tech.
* **DCA FTW**: Given possible short-term jitters post-GTC, consider dollar-cost averaging. Keep an eye on upcoming earnings and product launches.

**Risk Factors: Watch Your Six**

* **Production & Supply Chain**: If the new chips hit snags, short-term profits could take a hit.
* **Competition**: AMD, Intel, and other up-and-comers aren't sleeping; they want a piece of NVIDIA's pie.
* **Macro & Geopolitical**: Global economic hiccups, trade wars, or export bans could rain on NVIDIA's parade.
* **Tech & Product Risks**: If GTC doesn't wow or new products disappoint, investor enthusiasm might fizzle, leading to stock dips.

**TL;DR**

NVIDIA's killing it in the GPU and AI arena, with solid financials and exciting product launches on deck. GTC 2025 is the next big thing to watch. Short-term, the stock might wobble, but long-term prospects look juicy. Keep an eye on competition and global shenanigans, but overall, NVIDIA seems poised for more win.

Something nobody is really talking about is what a rare Earth minerals mining deal with the U.S. & Ukraine is doing to bring Russia to negotiate, so it is assumed by some that somehow the Russians will be buying the output from American operations there.

The lithium and other excavation companies were pretty volatile last year, so I'm not sure how much of this was already priced in.

They are probably going to make a deal regardless of the tumultuous interaction in the White House last week, but there is still a possibility that it all falls apart for the U.S.

Some people have been whispering about how Trump might have been positioning for personal gain on this, but since Canadian & European mining operations are also equally qualified (and available on the American exchange) it is likely that Zelenskyy now knows how valuable it is what they have.

So many variables here, wondering what the regards are planning down in the Wendy's dumpster ü§î "

Stop or GO for GO?(grocery outlet),0,1jfl46v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jfl46v/stop_or_go_for_gogrocery_outlet/,15,2025-03-20 15:11:06,"I need to make you all aware of Grocery Outlet (GO)

¬†I wanted to bring some awareness to grocery outlet. it seems like with the way the economy is turning, with a dozen eggs or a bag of m&ms sitting at 10$, Grocery Outlet is going to be the store people start paying attention to for the hot deals.¬†



Grocery Outlet is a rapidly growing discount supermarket located mostly on the west coast. They are a chain known for offering brand-name groceries and quality products at discounted prices. They operate using a unique opportunistic buying model, purchasing surplus inventory, discontinued products, and closeout deals from manufacturers and retailers, which allows them to give customers good deals on quality products.¬†

I do think that they are due for a breakout, despite the fact that their stock has been consistantly bearish over the last few years.¬†

#######

1. **Recession-Proof during pandemics: Grocery Outlet crushes it during economic downturns. During 2020 (yall know what happened ) they saw growth of up to 50% over the year. As inflation squeezes consumers, they flock to bargain stores.**

2. **Rapid Expansion Mode:** They've been opening new stores aggressively, strategically targeting suburban markets. New stores mean more market penetration, higher revenue, and stronger growth potential. Last year they opened 67 new stores, only closing 2.

3. Insider buying: Director Thomas Herman recently bought around 10,000 shares in open market transactions (Source: Yahoo Finance, SEC filings). Insider buying like this indicates strong belief in the stock's upward trajectory.

4. **Undervalued Against Competitors:**¬†Still undervalued compared to places like Dollar General or Aldi, Grocery Outlet offers major upside potential. I do think that they have more room to go down in price, possibly leading to better buying opportunities over the next year or two.¬†

5. **Personal Shopper Experience:** Personally, I regularly shop at Grocery Outlet and consistently find high-quality foods and goods at great prices. The store constantly rotates new products every month, keeping the shopping experience fresh and exciting. It's a great option for people like me who don't already have lots of extra money but prefer to purchase quality goods at lower prices. I generally get a better vibe shopping at a place like grocery outlet vs other discount grocery stores. It feels like a normal shopping experience, unlike Aldis where they make you bag your own groceries.¬†

¬†I'm just curious why the stock doesn't seem to get all that much volume compared to other retailers. I'm thinking of buying Long calls, but I'm also waiting to see how the price fluctuates before entering into a position over the next few months, perhaps waiting until their next earning? I'm also wondering how recent tarrifs or supply chain issues would affect GOs viability long term. What do you guys think? I think it's a stock worth observing and dca over the next year or two, or buying into long calls at cheap prices.

$72 million x4= $288mil cash flow. Convert to CAD is $412mil. KNT.TO currently has a $2.7 billion market cap. It‚Äôs trading at a mere 6x cash flow. This isn‚Äôt factoring future production at a now higher gold price, this would add an additional $15mil/quarter cash flow.

I think now that earnings are released and as market processes them KNT will go on a run all week to $13-14 range. IV has dropped and option premiums are dirt cheap. As I write this you can buy ITM $11 calls for $.45, only $0.08 premium. A run to $13 will 4x your money.

I'm going to attempt to explain to you regards why gold and silver mines print money and critical minerals projects are critically regarded.

**Rare Earths**

Rare earths are not rare! The main payable metal is NdPr Neodymium Praseodymium used for magnets. With Neodymium prices in the toilet due to China doing China things like injecting ammonium sulfate directly into the ground to leach the rare earths in situ, most hard rock projects like MP materials are losing money.

There are some great ionic clay rare earth projects out there with over 2% rare earth oxides but they exist on non freedom exchanges like the TSX and the ASX and are development projects that aren't mining anything yet.

The key issue with rare earths is processing capacity. This will probably get on-shored to the US in the next 5-10 years and China and Lynas Rare Earths will no longer be the only processors. This is why UUUU is the least regarded investment OP listed. DYODD.

**Lithium**

There was never a shortage of lithium, only a shortage of lithium processing capacity. Any deposit under 1% lithium is not going to be economic. Lithium is about as rare as copper. Guys at Exxon are developing direct lithium extraction technologies to extract lithium directly out of saltwater wells in [Arkansas](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/news/news-releases/2023/1113_exxonmobil-drilling-first-lithium-well-in-arkansas).

If they figure that out most existing hard rock mines may no longer be economical. Lithium is the most regarded bet. Any decent lithium project worth anything got built in the last few years.

**Gold and Silver**

We are in the beginning of a precious metals bull market. Any regard can see this in the gold chart. Historically silver prices tend to follow gold prices, but silver moons harder than gold does because the average regard is too poor to buy gold.

Gold is what central banks buy when their butt holes start to pucker. And they have been buying gold at record levels recently.

GDX and GDXJ are terrible bets because most gold companies are trash. Barrick was producing 5 million ounces 10 years ago now they're down to 2 million ounces. Nemont did so many acquisitions in the past 20 years ballooning its share count offsetting any kind of rise in profits or production they might have experienced. These companies have ruined the reputation of the mining sector for most institutions and retail investors.

It's best to bet on mid tier producers that are building or developing new mines.

Equinox Gold just reported great earnings as their new flagship gold mine in Canada has reached commercial nameplate capacity. While their new mine is printing money they will make the sustaining capital investments in their other mines that they have put off which will lead to even more baggies."

**TL;DR**

1. **Another Failed Privatization Attempt?**: Nordstrom‚Äôs previous privatization at $50 per share in 2018 was rejected by the board, and the company‚Äôs current financial performance shows a sharp decline, making such valuations unrealistic today. Having failed just 8 years ago at a much higher price, are they settling too low an amount and will shareholders vote against this privitization?
2. **Tariffs on Mexican Goods**: The recent U.S.'s 25% tariff on Mexican imports creates a significant challenge for any Mexican entity trying to acquire Nordstrom, especially given the company‚Äôs reliance on Mexican manufacturing.
3. **Ryan Cohen‚Äôs 4.2% Stake**: Cohen still holds a significant stake in Nordstrom, which could mean he's preparing for a potential strategic shift, sale, or restructuring.

**1. Another Failed Privatization Attempt ‚Äì Once bitten, Twice shy**

Let‚Äôs start with the history of Nordstrom (JWN) and a significant event that raised red flags for investors: the failed privatization attempt in 2018. The Nordstrom family made a bold attempt to take the company private at **$50 per share**, valuing the company at roughly **$8 billion**. This price point was based on optimism about the company‚Äôs prospects, and it was underpinned by Nordstrom's relatively strong revenue at the time.

The failed acquisition at the $50 per share valuation is a major indicator that investors, including the Nordstrom family, were betting on a much brighter future. Given the company‚Äôs current situation, a sale or acquisition at those former high prices may seem like a long shot now. The market sentiment, investor confidence, and Nordstrom‚Äôs future outlook don‚Äôt match the price tag that was set years ago. However given that they have also raised [FY24 outlook](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nordstrom-raises-fy24-revenue-outlook-185200374.html) one ponders if the acquisition price tag of **$24.25/share** is a fair one and shareholders will vote against this price?

**2. The 25% Tariff on Mexican Goods ‚Äì A New Complication for Potential Acquirers**

A major new development that could make any acquisition of Nordstrom even more complicated is the recent **25% tariff** imposed by the U.S. on all goods from Mexico. With Nordstrom having significant supply chains in Mexico ‚Äì especially in terms of manufacturing and sourcing goods ‚Äì these tariffs could have a substantial negative impact on the company‚Äôs cost structure.

As many of Nordstrom's products come from Mexican manufacturers, these tariffs will result in **higher production costs**, potentially leading to **lower margins** or increased prices for consumers. This economic strain might make Nordstrom less appealing to potential acquirers, particularly those from Mexico. The potential acquirer **Liverpool,¬†S.A.B. de C.V.**¬† said to have an interest in purchasing JWN, but these new tariffs complicate the calculus.

Given that the 25% tariff adds a layer of financial complexity, the attractiveness of a Nordstrom acquisition to a Mexican-based entity is highly diminished. These higher costs may force potential acquirers to either reprice their offers downward or back out of the deal entirely. This new trade barrier strengthens the likelihood that JWN could face prolonged struggles as its international market appeal is reduced.

**3. Ryan Cohen‚Äôs 4.2% Stake ‚Äì A Wildcard in the Mix**

Another intriguing aspect to consider is **Ryan Cohen**, the **Chewy** co-founder and activist investor. Cohen has long been known for shaking up companies in which he invests. He holds a **4.2% stake** in Nordstrom,  although this stake does not give him a significant voice in the company‚Äôs strategy. Cohen‚Äôs involvement in JWN raises several questions. Is he planning to influence the company‚Äôs direction or initiate changes that could lead to a potential sale? 

Given his involvement in **a gaming company**, Cohen has proven that he is not afraid to make bold moves to alter the fate of a company. Whether that means pushing for a restructuring, a sale, or advocating for a shift in the company‚Äôs strategic direction, Cohen‚Äôs presence on the shareholder registry is worth watching closely.

The real question becomes: **How will Cohen leverage his position?** Is he trying to push for a sale of the company at a time when its valuation is low, but the market is volatile, and the company is struggling?"
